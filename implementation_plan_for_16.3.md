## Implementation Achievements

The `connectionPairsNode` implementation has been successfully completed with the following key achievements:

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created detailed test cases covering input validation, agent invocation, response processing, error handling, and state management.

2. **Robust Error Handling**: Implemented specialized error handling for various scenarios, including missing inputs, LLM API errors, malformed responses, and JSON parsing failures.

3. **Flexible Response Processing**: Developed a dual-layer parsing approach that first attempts to parse JSON and falls back to regex extraction if needed, ensuring maximum resilience.

4. **State Management**: Implemented clean state update patterns with appropriate status tracking and message logging.

5. **TDD Approach**: Followed Test-Driven Development principles to ensure code quality and reliability.

The node successfully identifies meaningful connections between funder priorities and applicant capabilities, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent evaluation node.
