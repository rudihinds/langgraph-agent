# Frontend Refactoring Plan

## Overall Goal

Eliminate code duplication, consolidate scattered components, and establish a clean, maintainable folder structure for the Next.js frontend application. This refactoring focuses on removing exact duplicates, organizing shared components logically, and cleaning up deprecated code while maintaining 100% functional compatibility.

## Key Documentation

- [Next.js App Router Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
- [TypeScript Path Mapping](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#path-mapping)
- [Feature-Based Architecture](https://feature-sliced.design/)

## Current Status Summary

- ✅ Authentication system consolidated to single `useSession` hook
- ✅ Path aliases implemented (`@/` imports)
- ✅ SessionProvider properly added to layout
- ✅ Critical duplications consolidated (Phase 1 complete)
- ✅ Deprecated files cleanup complete (Phase 2 complete)
- ✅ Structural reorganization complete (Phase 3 complete)
- ✅ Technical debt cleanup complete (Phase 4 complete)

---

## Phase 1: Remove Exact Duplicates (Critical Priority)

### Step 1.1: Consolidate Message Shared Components ✅

**Issue**: Identical `shared.tsx` files exist in both chat-ui and thread features with 99% duplicate code.

**Files Affected**:

- `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/components/messages/shared.tsx` (canonical)
- ~~`apps/web/src/features/thread/components/messages/shared.tsx`~~ (deleted)

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Keep the chat-ui version as canonical (thread already imports TooltipIconButton from chat-ui)
2. ✅ Find all imports of thread version: No imports found using thread version
3. ✅ Update imports to use chat-ui version: Updated thread/messages/ai.tsx and human.tsx
4. ✅ Delete duplicate file: `apps/web/src/features/thread/components/messages/shared.tsx`
5. ✅ Test that all message functionality works in both contexts

**Justification**: Thread feature already depends on chat-ui for TooltipIconButton, so consolidating shared message components in chat-ui maintains logical dependency hierarchy.

### Step 1.2: Consolidate Markdown Text Components ✅

**Issue**: Different markdown rendering components in both features - thread version more advanced.

**Files Affected**:

- `apps/web/src/features/thread/components/markdown-text.tsx` (canonical - more advanced)
- ~~`apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/components/markdown-text.tsx`~~ (deleted basic version)

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Compare files - thread version is more advanced with math support, copy functionality
2. ✅ Update chat-ui imports to use thread version (better features)
3. ✅ Delete basic chat-ui version
4. ✅ Verify markdown rendering works in both contexts

### Step 1.3: Consolidate Agent Inbox Components ✅

**Issue**: Overlapping agent inbox functionality across features.

**Files Affected**:

- `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/components/agent-inbox/` (comprehensive inbox view)
- `apps/web/src/features/thread/components/agent-inbox/` (simple ThreadView component)

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Audit both implementations to identify unique functionality
2. ✅ Analysis: These serve different purposes - chat-ui has full inbox management, thread has simple state/description view
3. ✅ Decision: Keep both as they're not duplicates but complementary components
4. ✅ No consolidation needed - different use cases
5. ✅ Both components tested and working correctly

**Justification**: After analysis, these components serve different purposes and aren't duplicates. Chat-UI provides comprehensive interrupt management while Thread provides focused state viewing.

---

## Phase 2: Remove Deprecated Files (Low Risk)

### Step 2.1: Clean Up Deprecated Auth Files ✅

**Issue**: Files marked with `@deprecated` comments are no longer used.

**Files to Delete**:

- ~~`apps/web/src/features/auth/api/index[dep].ts`~~ (deleted)
- ~~`apps/web/src/features/auth/api/actions[dep].ts`~~ (deleted)
- ~~`apps/web/src/lib/supabase/compatibility.ts`~~ (deleted)
- ~~`apps/web/app/api/proposals/actions[dep].ts`~~ (deleted)

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Verify no active imports exist: `grep -r "index\[dep\]" apps/web/src`
2. ✅ Verify no active imports exist: `grep -r "actions\[dep\]" apps/web/src`
3. ✅ Verify no active imports exist: `grep -r "compatibility" apps/web/src`
4. ✅ Delete files if no active references found
5. ✅ Run build to confirm no breaking changes

### Step 2.2: Clean Up Deprecated Type Definitions ✅

**Issue**: Type definitions marked as deprecated should be removed.

**Files Affected**:

- ~~`apps/web/src/features/auth/types/index.ts`~~ (deleted - was duplicate)
- `apps/web/src/lib/supabase/types/index.ts` (cleaned up)

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Identify all `@deprecated` type exports (SignInResult, SignOutResult)
2. ✅ Search for usage of deprecated types (none found)
3. ✅ Replace with recommended alternatives (already existed)
4. ✅ Remove deprecated type definitions
5. ✅ Consolidate duplicate type files

---

## Phase 3: Structural Reorganization (Foundation)

### Step 3.1: Consolidate Top-Level Components ✅

**Issue**: Mixed component organization in `apps/web/src/components/`.

**Current Structure**: ~~Removed entirely~~

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Audit components for actual usage (none found)
2. ✅ Delete unused LoginForm component
3. ✅ Delete unused Sidebar component
4. ✅ Remove empty `components/` directory tree
5. ✅ Verify no breaking changes (dev server restart needed)

**Result**: Removed entire `/src/components` directory as all components were unused legacy code.

### Step 3.2: Reorganize Lib Structure ✅

**Issue**: Inconsistent organization of utility functions and API clients.

**Completed Structure**:

```
apps/web/src/lib/
├── api/
│   ├── client.ts (moved from api.ts)
│   └── route-handler.ts (existing)
├── auth/
│   ├── client.ts (moved from auth-client.ts)
│   └── user-management.ts (moved from root)
├── utils/
│   ├── agent-inbox-interrupt.ts (moved from root)
│   ├── api-key.tsx (moved from root)
│   ├── diagnostic-tools.ts (moved from root)
│   ├── ensure-tool-responses.ts (moved from root)
│   ├── date-utils.ts (existing)
│   ├── interrupt-detection.ts (existing)
│   ├── langgraph-client.ts (existing)
│   ├── utils.ts (existing)
│   └── index.ts (existing)
└── supabase/ (kept existing structure)
```

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Create new directory structure
2. ✅ Move and consolidate related utilities (7 files moved)
3. ✅ Update imports across codebase (none found - files weren't being used)
4. ✅ Remove old scattered files from lib root
5. ✅ Clear build caches to prevent stale references

**Result**: Organized lib structure with logical grouping. Dev server restart required after cache clearing.

---

## Phase 4: Technical Debt Cleanup (Polish)

### Step 4.1: Resolve High-Priority TODOs ✅

**Files with Critical TODOs**: None found!

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Scan codebase for TODO comments: `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" apps/web/src` (none found)
2. ✅ Scan for console statements: `grep -r "console\." apps/web/src` (none found)
3. ✅ Scan for TypeScript suppressions: `grep -r "@ts-ignore\|@ts-nocheck" apps/web/src` (none found)
4. ✅ Categorize by priority (no items to categorize)
5. ✅ Resolve high-priority items immediately (no items found)

**Result**: Codebase is clean of technical debt markers and debug statements.

### Step 4.2: Standardize Component Naming ✅

**Issue**: Mixed naming patterns across components.

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Audit all component file names for consistency
2. ✅ Ensure PascalCase for all component files (most follow conventions)
3. ✅ Update imports after any renames (none needed)
4. ✅ Verify build still works

**Result**: Component naming follows established patterns:

- UI components (shadcn/ui): kebab-case (conventional)
- React components: PascalCase (correct)
- Hooks: kebab-case with `use-` prefix (conventional)
- Providers: kebab-case (conventional)
- HOCs: kebab-case with descriptive prefix (conventional)

**Decision**: Keep current naming as it follows React ecosystem conventions.

### Step 4.3: Organize Test Files ✅

**Issue**: Inconsistent test file organization.

**Action Items**:

1. ✅ Ensure all test files are in `__tests__` directories
2. ✅ Move any misplaced test files (moved 1 file: ApplicationQuestionsView.test.tsx)
3. ✅ Update test imports if needed (none needed)
4. ✅ Run test suite to verify everything works

**Result**: All test files now properly organized in `__tests__` directories following Jest/Vitest conventions.
