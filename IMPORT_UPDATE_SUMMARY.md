# Import Path Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the import path updates made during the refactoring process to support the new feature-based directory structure in the `/apps/web` application.

## Main Import Path Mappings

The following import path mappings were applied across the codebase:

### Auth Feature

- `@/components/auth/` → `@/features/auth/components/`
- `@/lib/auth/` → `@/features/auth/utils/`
- `@/hooks/useSession` → `@/features/auth/hooks/useSession`
- `@/hooks/useCurrentUser` → `@/features/auth/hooks/useCurrentUser`
- `@/hooks/useRequireAuth` → `@/features/auth/hooks/useRequireAuth`

### Proposals Feature

- `@/components/proposals/` → `@/features/proposals/components/`
- `@/lib/proposal-actions/` → `@/features/proposals/utils/`
- `@/hooks/useProposal` → `@/features/proposals/hooks/useProposal`
- `@/hooks/useRfpForm` → `@/features/proposals/hooks/useRfpForm`

### Thread Feature

- `@/components/thread/` → `@/features/thread/components/`
- `@/components/chat-ui/thread/` → `@/features/thread/components/`
- `@/components/chat-ui/lib/` → `@/features/thread/utils/`
- `@/components/thread/agent-inbox/hooks/` → `@/features/thread/hooks/`

### UI Components

- `@/components/ui/` → `@/features/ui/components/`
- `../ui/button` → `@/features/ui/components/button`
- `../ui/*` → `@/features/ui/components/*`

### Shared Components

- `@/components/icons/` → `@/components/shared/icons/`
- `@/components/layout/` → `@/features/layout/components/`
- `@/components/shared/` → `@/features/shared/components/`

### Utility Paths

- `@/lib/utils/utils` → `@/features/shared/utils/utils`
- `@/lib/ensure-tool-responses` → `@/features/shared/utils/ensure-tool-responses`
- `@/hooks/useMediaQuery` → `@/features/shared/hooks/useMediaQuery`

### DB/Schema Paths

- `@/lib/schema/` → `@/lib/supabase/db/schema/`
- `@/lib/schemas/` → `@/schemas/`

### Error Handling

- `@/lib/errors/` → `@/features/shared/errors/`

### API

- `@/lib/api/` → `@/features/api/utils/`

### Providers

- `@/providers/` → `@/features/providers/`

## Relative Imports Handling

The scripts also fixed up relative imports in moved files. For example:

- `../ui/` → `@/features/ui/components/`
- `../icons/` → `@/components/shared/icons/`

## Quote Fixing

Several files had mixed quote styles in import statements that were fixed:

- `'@/path"` → `'@/path'`
- `"@/path'` → `"@/path"`

## Files Updated

Over 80 files were updated with proper import paths across the codebase.

## Next Steps

While all import paths have been updated, there may still be additional TypeScript configurations needed to fully support the new file structure:

1. Update `tsconfig.json` path mappings to include the new feature-based structure
2. Configure the JSX settings properly
3. Ensure all imported libraries have the correct type declarations
