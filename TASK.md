## Rate Limiting Middleware Improvements

### Overview

We've implemented a basic IP-based rate limiting middleware that currently stores data in-memory and provides essential protection against excessive requests. This MVP implementation is sufficient for launch with an initial small user base (up to ~500 users), but will require improvements as the application scales.

### Near-Term Improvements (Post-Launch)

These should be addressed relatively soon after launch, before significant user growth:

- **[HIGH]** Add error handling to cleanup function

  - Current issue: Unhandled errors in the cleanup interval will permanently stop cleanup process
  - Risk: Memory leaks leading to performance degradation and potential crashes
  - Fix: Wrap cleanup logic in try/catch to ensure continued operation even if an iteration fails

- **[MEDIUM]** Implement basic input validation for configuration options

  - Current issue: Configuration parameters aren't validated, allowing invalid values
  - Risk: Unexpected behavior with negative or extremely large values for window time or request limits
  - Fix: Add simple checks for parameters with appropriate defaults/constraints

- **[MEDIUM]** Add upper bounds for Map size

  - Current issue: Potential for unbounded memory growth between cleanup cycles
  - Risk: Memory exhaustion during traffic spikes, even with cleanup intervals
  - Fix: Implement size limits with eviction policies (e.g., LRU) for the store

- **[LOW]** Document middleware ordering requirements
  - Current issue: Insufficient guidance on where rate limiting should appear in middleware chain
  - Risk: Inefficient application if placed after expensive operations
  - Fix: Expand documentation with specific placement recommendations

### Long-Term Improvements (Larger Team & User Base)

These should be considered as the application and team scales:

- **[HIGH]** Implement distributed storage option

  - Current issue: In-memory storage doesn't work across multiple application instances
  - Risk: Ineffective rate limiting in load-balanced/horizontally-scaled environments
  - Solution: Add support for Redis or database-backed storage with configurable adapters

- **[HIGH]** Address IP spoofing vulnerabilities

  - Current issue: Reliance on X-Forwarded-For header without verification
  - Risk: Rate limit bypass through header spoofing
  - Solution: Implement header validation or alternative client identification methods

- **[MEDIUM]** Optimize cleanup performance

  - Current issue: O(n) cleanup becomes expensive with large numbers of tracked IPs
  - Risk: Cleanup process impacts application performance as user base grows
  - Solution: Implement time-bucketed data structures for more efficient expiration

- **[MEDIUM]** Support alternative rate limiting algorithms

  - Current issue: Fixed time windows can allow request bursts at window boundaries
  - Risk: Less effective protection compared to more sophisticated algorithms
  - Solution: Implement sliding window or token bucket algorithms as configuration options

- **[MEDIUM]** Integrate with authentication system

  - Current issue: All clients have same rate limits regardless of authentication status
  - Risk: Legitimate power users face same restrictions as anonymous clients
  - Solution: Allow for user/role-based rate limiting tied to authentication

- **[LOW]** Improve cleanup lifecycle management

  - Current issue: Cleanup interval runs forever with no way to stop it
  - Risk: Resource waste and potential memory leaks
  - Solution: Implement proper start/stop controls for cleanup process

- **[LOW]** Enhance configuration options
  - Current issue: Limited configurability for advanced use cases
  - Risk: Custom requirements need middleware modifications
  - Solution: Expand configuration API for custom response formats, headers, etc.

## Document Loader Improvements

### Overview

We've implemented a document loader node that handles RFP document retrieval from Supabase storage with support for both authenticated and server-side clients. While the implementation is functional and passes all tests, there are several areas for improvement to enhance security, performance, and reliability.

### Priority Improvements

- **[HIGH]** Implement document size validation and limits

  - Current issue: No size checks before loading entire documents into memory
  - Risk: Memory overflow errors with large RFPs (>50MB)
  - Fix: Add size validation before loading, implement streaming for large documents

- **[HIGH]** Add rfpId validation and sanitization

  - Current issue: No sanitization of rfpId before constructing storage paths
  - Risk: Potential path traversal vulnerabilities if rfpId comes from untrusted sources
  - Fix: Implement strict validation of rfpId format with regex or dedicated validator

- **[HIGH]** Support multiple documents per RFP

  - Current issue: Architecture assumes single document per RFP (`${rfpId}/document.pdf`)
  - Risk: Unable to handle real-world RFPs with multiple documents/attachments
  - Fix: Redesign storage path structure and loader to support document collections

- **[MEDIUM]** Implement retry mechanism for transient errors

  - Current issue: No retry attempts for network issues or temporary Supabase unavailability
  - Risk: Document loading fails unnecessarily on recoverable errors
  - Fix: Implement backoff retry strategy for non-authorization errors

- **[MEDIUM]** Add caching for frequently accessed documents

  - Current issue: Documents are fetched from storage on every request
  - Risk: Increased latency and storage costs with frequent access
  - Fix: Implement document caching with appropriate invalidation strategies

- **[MEDIUM]** Improve error classification robustness

  - Current issue: Using string matching (`includes("not found")`) to classify errors
  - Risk: Breaking changes if Supabase modifies error message formats
  - Fix: Create more reliable error classification mechanisms

- **[MEDIUM]** Add document format flexibility

  - Current issue: `DEFAULT_FORMAT` constant hardcodes PDF assumption
  - Risk: Unable to support other common formats like DOCX, TXT, etc.
  - Fix: Implement format detection and multi-format support

- **[MEDIUM]** Decouple from state schema

  - Current issue: Tight coupling with `OverallProposalState` structure
  - Risk: Changes to state schema require updates to document loader implementation
  - Fix: Implement adapter pattern to separate concerns

- **[LOW]** Enhance logging with operational metrics

  - Current issue: Logs contain basic info but miss useful operational metrics
  - Risk: Difficult to identify performance issues or degradation over time
  - Fix: Add document size, processing time, and user context to all logs

- **[LOW]** Implement partial document recovery

  - Current issue: No ability to partially recover from corrupted documents
  - Risk: All-or-nothing document loading leads to unnecessary failures
  - Fix: Add content extraction from partially valid documents when possible

### Long-Term Improvements

- **[HIGH]** Implement streaming document processing

  - Current issue: Entire documents loaded into memory before processing
  - Risk: Memory constraints limit maximum document size
  - Solution: Implement streaming document processing to handle arbitrarily large files

- **[MEDIUM]** Add document preprocessing capabilities

  - Current issue: Documents are passed directly to parser without optimization
  - Risk: Suboptimal parsing results with poorly formatted documents
  - Solution: Add preprocessing steps like OCR, format normalization, etc.

- **[MEDIUM]** Implement content-based format detection

  - Current issue: Format determined solely by file extension
  - Risk: Incorrectly named files cause parsing failures
  - Solution: Add content-based format detection as fallback

- **[MEDIUM]** Create document versioning support

  - Current issue: No version tracking for documents
  - Risk: Can't track changes to RFP documents over time
  - Solution: Implement versioning system with historical access

- **[LOW]** Add document structure validation

  - Current issue: No validation of document structure before parsing
  - Risk: Malformed documents cause parser failures
  - Solution: Implement document validation before full parsing
