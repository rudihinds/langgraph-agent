# Implementation Plan: API Endpoint for Saving New Proposals

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps required to implement the API endpoint for saving new proposals, connecting the frontend proposal creation flow to the Supabase database, and ensuring proper data persistence.

## Sub-Tasks

### # 1. Create Proposal Interface and Schema Validation

**Purpose:** Define a comprehensive type interface and validation schema for proposal data to ensure type safety and data integrity.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Write test cases for proposal data validation with expected success and failure scenarios
2. Create a `ProposalSchema.ts` file in the `shared/types` directory with Zod schemas
3. Implement interfaces for both application-type and RFP-type proposals
4. Add validation functions with proper error messages
5. Test validation with edge cases (missing fields, invalid data formats)
6. Ensure schema supports all required fields from the UI components

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Zod for schema validation
- Include separate schemas for different proposal types (application vs. RFP)
- Define clear error messages for each validation failure
- Implement type guards for runtime type checking
- Support optional fields with sensible defaults

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle partial saves for in-progress proposals
- Account for various data types (text, dates, numbers)
- Consider serialization/deserialization for complex objects

### # 2. Implement API Route for Proposal Creation

**Purpose:** Create a Next.js API route that securely handles proposal creation requests and interacts with the Supabase database.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Write test specifications for the API route using Vitest, including authentication tests
2. Create an API route at `app/api/proposals/route.ts` with POST method handling
3. Implement authentication middleware to ensure only logged-in users can create proposals
4. Add input validation using the proposal schema
5. Create database interaction logic using Supabase client
6. Add proper error handling and response formatting
7. Test with various input scenarios and error conditions

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Next.js App Router API route handlers
- Implement proper status codes (201 for creation, 400 for validation errors, 401 for unauthorized)
- Add request rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Ensure database queries are optimized
- Log all errors for monitoring

**Security Considerations:**
- Validate user authentication via Supabase session
- Sanitize all user input before database operations
- Implement Row Level Security policies in Supabase
- Return only necessary data in responses

### # 3. Integrate Database Operations with Supabase

**Purpose:** Create a robust data layer for proposal storage that handles all database operations with proper error handling and transaction support.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Write tests for database operations with mocked Supabase client
2. Create a `proposalRepository.ts` file with CRUD functions
3. Implement transaction handling for atomicity
4. Add error handling with specific error types
5. Test database operations with different proposal types
6. Ensure proper Row Level Security policies are applied
7. Verify data integrity with serialization/deserialization tests

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Supabase SDK for database operations
- Implement optimistic concurrency control
- Create stored procedures for complex operations if needed
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- Ensure proper foreign key relationships

**Data Integrity Considerations:**
- Handle proposal versioning for updates
- Implement soft delete for proposals
- Create audit trail for significant operations
- Handle database errors gracefully

### # 4. Update Frontend Components for API Integration

**Purpose:** Connect the existing proposal creation flow UI components to the new API endpoint, handling loading states, errors, and success feedback.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Write tests for frontend API integration
2. Create a custom hook `useProposalSubmission` for handling API calls
3. Integrate the hook with the `ProposalCreationFlow` component
4. Add loading states, error handling, and success notifications
5. Implement retry logic for failed submissions
6. Test edge cases like network failures and server errors
7. Add proper form validation before submission

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use React Query or SWR for data fetching
- Implement progressive enhancement for JS-disabled environments
- Add error boundary for graceful error rendering
- Create toast notifications for submission status
- Use Suspense for loading states

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Ensure form validation errors are announced to screen readers
- Add aria-busy attributes during loading
- Create focus management for error/success states
- Ensure keyboard navigation works during all states
- Add progress indicators with proper ARIA attributes

### # 5. Implement Proposal Storage for File Attachments

**Purpose:** Create a secure storage system for RFP document uploads with proper access controls, file validation, and optimized storage.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Write tests for file upload and retrieval functionality
2. Create a Supabase Storage bucket configuration for proposal documents
3. Implement file upload handling in the API route
4. Add file type validation and size limits
5. Create a preview component for uploaded files
6. Test with various file types and sizes
7. Implement access controls for file viewing/downloading

**Technical Requirements:**
- Configure Supabase Storage with proper permissions
- Implement client-side file validation
- Add server-side validation as a security measure
- Create signed URLs for secure file access
- Set up proper CORS configuration

**File Handling Considerations:**
- Limit file sizes (e.g., 10MB maximum)
- Restrict file types to safe formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Implement virus scanning for uploaded files if possible
- Add file compression for large documents
- Create thumbnails for preview purposes

### # 6. Add Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery

**Purpose:** Implement robust error handling throughout the proposal creation process to ensure user data is never lost and errors are properly communicated.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Write tests for various error scenarios
2. Implement client-side form data persistence (localStorage)
3. Create error boundary components for React rendering errors
4. Add retry mechanisms for API calls
5. Implement detailed error logging
6. Create user-friendly error messages
7. Test recovery from various failure points

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use consistent error message formatting
- Implement proper error codes for tracking
- Add telemetry for error monitoring
- Create fallback UI components
- Implement auto-save functionality

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle browser crashes/page reloads
- Account for session timeouts
- Consider multi-tab usage scenarios
- Implement conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Handle partially completed submissions

### # 7. Create End-to-End Tests for Proposal Creation Flow

**Purpose:** Ensure the entire proposal creation flow works correctly from UI interaction to database storage with comprehensive end-to-end tests.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
2. Create test scenarios for application-type proposal creation
3. Add test scenarios for RFP-type proposal creation
4. Implement authentication testing
5. Test error scenarios and recovery
6. Create accessibility tests
7. Run tests across multiple browsers

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use Playwright for browser testing
- Implement test database isolation
- Create test fixtures for different proposal types
- Add visual regression testing
- Automate test runs in CI/CD pipeline

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Cover all user flows (happy paths)
- Test all validation error scenarios
- Verify database state after operations
- Test accessibility compliance
- Ensure responsive behavior across devices
