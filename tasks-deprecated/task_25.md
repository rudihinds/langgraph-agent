# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Document Version Control System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a sophisticated version control system for proposal documents

# Details:
Develop a comprehensive version control system specifically designed for proposal documents that allows teams to track changes, manage revisions, compare versions, and collaborate effectively throughout the proposal development lifecycle.

## Key Components:

1. **Document Versioning**:
   - Implement automatic version incrementation
   - Create snapshot creation on major milestones
   - Develop branch management for alternative approaches
   - Implement merge functionality for concurrent edits
   - Create rollback capabilities to previous versions
   - Develop version tagging and annotations

2. **Change Tracking**:
   - Implement granular change detection (paragraph, sentence, word)
   - Create user attribution for all changes
   - Develop timestamp recording for audit trails
   - Implement change categorization (content, formatting, structure)
   - Create change impact assessment
   - Develop dependency tracking between sections

3. **Comparison Tools**:
   - Implement side-by-side version comparison
   - Create visual diff highlighting
   - Develop semantic change detection
   - Implement content drift analysis
   - Create quality trend visualization
   - Develop metadata comparison

4. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Implement section locking during editing
   - Create change notification system
   - Develop comment threading on specific versions
   - Implement approval workflows for version promotion
   - Create collaborative editing with conflict resolution
   - Develop role-based access controls for versions

5. **Integration Capabilities**:
   - Implement export of version differences
   - Create integration with external document systems
   - Develop API for third-party tools
   - Implement webhook triggers for version events
   - Create backup and archiving automation
   - Develop compliance reporting on version history

6. **Intelligent Features**:
   - Implement quality trend analysis across versions
   - Create automatic identification of risky changes
   - Develop suggestion of optimal version paths
   - Implement content reversion recommendations
   - Create early warning for version conflicts
   - Develop collaborative efficiency metrics

## Implementation Guidelines:

- Storage efficiency should be maximized through delta-based versioning
- User interface must be intuitive for non-technical users
- Performance should remain consistent even with numerous versions
- Security controls should protect sensitive version data
- Scalability should accommodate large proposal documents
- Offline capabilities should support disconnected work
- Compliance with document retention policies must be ensured
- Integration with existing workflow tools should be seamless
- Version metadata should be extensible for custom attributes
- Automatic conflict resolution should minimize manual intervention

## Expected Outcomes:

- Comprehensive audit trail of all proposal changes
- Improved collaboration efficiency among team members
- Reduced risk of content loss or unintended changes
- Increased proposal quality through better version management
- Enhanced compliance with documentation requirements
- More effective utilization of previous proposal content
- Reduced time spent on manual version management
- Improved accountability for proposal content
- Better visibility into proposal development process
- Increased ability to meet tight proposal deadlines

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance testing with large document histories
2. Usability testing with proposal team members
3. Integration testing with existing document systems
4. Stress testing concurrent editing scenarios
5. Security testing for access controls
6. Comparison testing against industry version control systems
7. Offline capability testing
8. Recovery testing from corrupted versions
9. Conflict resolution testing with forced collisions
10. Long-term storage and retrieval testing
