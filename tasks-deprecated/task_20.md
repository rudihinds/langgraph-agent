# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Proposal Knowledge Graph
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build knowledge representation for proposal context and research

# Details:
Design and implement a knowledge graph system that represents proposal-related information, research findings, domain expertise, and client requirements in a structured, queryable format. This knowledge graph will serve as the backbone for intelligent reasoning, consistency checking, and knowledge retrieval during the proposal generation process.

## Key Components:

1. **Knowledge Schema Design**:
   - Define entity types (clients, requirements, domain concepts, etc.)
   - Create relationship types with semantic meanings
   - Design property schemas for entities and relationships
   - Implement schema validation and enforcement
   - Create extensible type hierarchies
   - Add versioning for schema evolution

2. **Knowledge Acquisition**:
   - Implement extraction from RFP documents
   - Create research result integration
   - Add manual knowledge entry interface
   - Implement external knowledge base connectors
   - Create incremental knowledge updates
   - Add confidence scoring for extracted knowledge

3. **Graph Storage and Indexing**:
   - Implement efficient graph database integration
   - Create specialized indexes for common query patterns
   - Add caching for frequent queries
   - Implement transaction support for updates
   - Create backup and restoration mechanisms
   - Add performance monitoring

4. **Query Interface**:
   - Implement natural language querying
   - Create structured query API
   - Add query templates for common patterns
   - Implement semantic similarity search
   - Create context-aware querying
   - Add pagination and streaming for large results

5. **Reasoning and Inference**:
   - Implement rule-based inference
   - Create relationship inference
   - Add missing information detection
   - Implement contradiction detection
   - Create probability-based reasoning
   - Add explanation generation for inferences

6. **Integration with Agent Workflow**:
   - Implement knowledge retrieval API for agents
   - Create update mechanisms from agent findings
   - Add context-aware knowledge filtering
   - Implement personalized knowledge views
   - Create activity logging for knowledge usage
   - Add knowledge gap identification

7. **Visualization and Exploration**:
   - Implement interactive graph visualization
   - Create knowledge exploration UI
   - Add relationship highlighting
   - Implement filtering and focus controls
   - Create exportable knowledge summaries
   - Add visual query building

## Implementation Guidelines:

- The knowledge graph should prioritize proposal-specific concepts and relationships
- Schema design should balance specificity with flexibility for diverse proposals
- Knowledge acquisition should prioritize accuracy over completeness
- Query interfaces should support both precise and exploratory queries
- Reasoning should clearly distinguish between facts and inferences
- The graph should maintain provenance for all knowledge
- The system should scale to handle thousands of entities and relationships
- Integration with agents should be bidirectional and asynchronous
- Visualization should provide valuable insights without overwhelming complexity

## Expected Outcomes:

- Enhanced proposal consistency through shared knowledge representation
- Improved research impact through structured information integration
- Reduced redundancy in information gathering through centralized knowledge
- More accurate alignment with client requirements through explicit representation
- Easier identification of knowledge gaps requiring additional research
- Better traceability between proposal statements and supporting evidence
- Enhanced quality control through consistency checking
- More efficient agent collaboration through shared knowledge context
- Improved client confidence through comprehensive knowledge representation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test schema validation with diverse knowledge types
2. Verify extraction accuracy from sample RFP documents
3. Test query performance with large knowledge graphs
4. Verify inference correctness with known patterns
5. Test bidirectional integration with agent workflows
6. Create visualization tests for complex knowledge structures
7. Verify contradiction detection with conflicting information
8. Test schema evolution with changing requirements
9. Create performance benchmarks for different graph sizes
10. Test knowledge provenance tracking end-to-end
