# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Orchestrator Agent Node
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the central coordination node for the agent system
# Details:
Implement the orchestrator node that manages workflow and user interactions. Create functions for routing to appropriate subgraphs, managing high-level state, and handling user feedback. Implement proper error handling and retries for LLM operations.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases for orchestrator routing logic. Verify proper handling of user input and appropriate routing to subgraphs. Test error handling and recovery mechanisms.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Orchestrator Node Core Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the basic structure of the orchestrator node with core functionality for initialization, state management, and interface definition
### Details:
1. Create an OrchestratorNode class with initialization parameters for required services and configurations
2. Implement state management functionality to track workflow status and agent states
3. Define clear interfaces for communication with subgraphs/agents
4. Add logging infrastructure for tracking orchestrator operations
5. Implement configuration loading for orchestrator settings
6. Test the core structure by initializing the orchestrator with mock dependencies and verifying state management functions work correctly

## 2. Implement Workflow Routing and Coordination Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop the logic for routing requests to appropriate subgraphs and coordinating the workflow between different agents
### Details:
1. Create a routing mechanism to direct requests to appropriate subgraphs based on task type and context
2. Implement workflow management functions to track progress through multi-step processes
3. Add coordination logic to sequence agent operations correctly
4. Develop context management to maintain and pass relevant information between agents
5. Implement timeout and cancellation handling for long-running operations
6. Test routing logic with mock subgraphs to verify correct dispatch of requests
7. Test workflow coordination with simulated multi-step processes

## 3. Add Error Handling, Retries, and User Feedback Systems [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Enhance the orchestrator with robust error handling, retry mechanisms for LLM operations, and user feedback processing
### Details:
1. Implement comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios (network issues, LLM errors, agent failures)
2. Create a retry mechanism specifically for LLM operations with configurable parameters (max attempts, backoff strategy)
3. Develop user feedback collection and processing capabilities
4. Add functionality to incorporate user feedback into workflow decisions
5. Implement recovery strategies for different error types
6. Create monitoring hooks to track system health and performance
7. Test error handling by simulating various failure conditions
8. Test retry logic by forcing LLM operation failures and verifying recovery
9. Test user feedback system with mock user inputs and verify correct adaptation of workflow
