# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Persistence Layer with Checkpointing
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement checkpoint-based persistence using Supabase
# Details:
Create a PostgresCheckpointer class that integrates with Supabase. Implement checkpoint saving, loading, and thread management. Ensure proper serialization of state between checkpoint operations. Set up thread-based organization for proposals with consistent thread_id patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Test checkpoint save and load with complex state objects. Verify thread persistence across sessions. Test error handling during persistence operations.
