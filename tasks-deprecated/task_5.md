# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Research Agent Subgraph
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the research capabilities for analyzing RFP documents and funder information

# Details:
Implement the Research Agent subgraph to analyze RFP documents, extract key requirements, and gather information about the funding organization. This is a critical component that provides the foundation for the entire proposal generation process.

Key components to implement:

1. **Research Agent Subgraph Structure**:
   - Create the research agent state annotation extending the proposal state
   - Implement the main research subgraph with appropriate nodes
   - Create entry and exit points with proper state transformations
   - Define interfaces for orchestrator integration

2. **Document Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Implement RFP document parsing and text extraction
   - Create semantic chunking for large documents
   - Implement key requirement extraction with LLM-based analysis
   - Add priority detection for requirements

3. **Funder Research Functionality**:
   - Implement vector store integration for knowledge retrieval
   - Create research planning for targeted information gathering
   - Add summarization capabilities for research results
   - Implement history and previous grants analysis

4. **Research Plan Generation**:
   - Create a dynamic research planning node
   - Implement step-by-step research execution
   - Add aggregation for multi-source research
   - Create coherent summary generation from research

5. **Tool Integration**:
   - Integrate with vector database for knowledge retrieval
   - Implement web search tool for finding funder information
   - Create document processing tools for PDF/DOC handling
   - Add structured data extraction for tables and lists

6. **State Management**:
   - Create specialized reducers for research state
   - Implement progressive state updates during research
   - Add research history tracking
   - Create checkpointing hooks for long-running research

The research agent should follow this rough flow:
1. Parse and analyze the RFP document
2. Identify key requirements and evaluation criteria
3. Generate a research plan for the funding organization
4. Execute the research plan step by step
5. Aggregate and summarize the research findings
6. Store the structured results in the proposal state

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for document parsing with sample RFPs
2. Test requirement extraction accuracy with diverse document types
3. Verify research planning with different funding scenarios
4. Test vector store integration with mock knowledge base
5. Benchmark performance with large documents
6. Test error handling during research operations
7. Create integration tests with the orchestrator
8. Verify proper state transformations during the research flow
