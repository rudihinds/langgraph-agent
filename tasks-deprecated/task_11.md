# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Proposal Manager Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the top-level agent that coordinates all proposal generation activities and manages the overall workflow

# Details:
Implement the Proposal Manager Agent, the central orchestration component responsible for coordinating all proposal generation activities, managing the workflow, and ensuring consistency and quality across all proposal sections. This agent will serve as the primary interface between the human user and the underlying generation system.

Key components to implement:

1. **Proposal Workflow Management**:
   - Create the main workflow graph with appropriate state transitions
   - Implement parallel and sequential section generation control
   - Add dependency tracking between sections
   - Create progress tracking and reporting
   - Implement checkpoint creation and state persistence
   - Add recovery mechanisms for interrupted workflows

2. **Human Interaction Interface**:
   - Create human feedback collection nodes
   - Implement approval workflows for sections
   - Add revision request handling
   - Create clarification question generation
   - Implement preference tracking across sessions
   - Add inline editing suggestions processing

3. **Section Coordination**:
   - Implement section generator invocation logic
   - Create cross-section consistency checking
   - Add terminology and style uniformity enforcement
   - Create reference and citation standardization
   - Implement transition generation between sections

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Create comprehensive QA checks for completed proposals
   - Implement alignment verification with RFP requirements
   - Add completeness check for all required elements
   - Create style and tone consistency validation
   - Implement formatting standardization
   - Add error and edge case handling

5. **Revision Management**:
   - Create versioning system for proposal drafts
   - Implement selective section regeneration
   - Add targeted revision based on feedback
   - Create change tracking and highlighting
   - Implement revision history maintenance
   - Add comparison tools for versions

6. **Timeline Management**:
   - Create deadline tracking and alerts
   - Implement section time allocation
   - Add time-based prioritization
   - Create pacing recommendations
   - Implement adaptation to timeline changes

7. **Metadata Management**:
   - Create proposal metadata tracking
   - Implement tag and categorization systems
   - Add search indexing for proposals
   - Create organization-specific customization storage
   - Implement template and style preference management

8. **Export and Formatting**:
   - Create document generation in multiple formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
   - Implement style template application
   - Add visual element integration (charts, tables, images)
   - Create table of contents and index generation
   - Implement header/footer standardization
   - Add accessibility compliance checking

9. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Create token budget management for LLM calls
   - Implement cost tracking and estimation
   - Add parallelization optimization
   - Create caching strategies for efficiency
   - Implement token-saving preprocessing

The Proposal Manager Agent should support the following workflow:
1. Intake RFP information and research from the Research Agent
2. Create and manage a logical proposal outline
3. Coordinate section generation in the appropriate sequence
4. Present sections to users for review and feedback
5. Manage revisions and regeneration as needed
6. Ensure consistency across all proposal components
7. Handle final assembly and export
8. Maintain state and recover from interruptions

The agent should maintain a comprehensive proposal state including:
- Section status (not started, in progress, draft, approved)
- Revision history and feedback for each section
- Cross-section dependencies and consistency tracking
- Timeline and deadline information
- User preferences and style guides
- Export format requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for all node functions
2. Test state transitions with simulated inputs
3. Create integration tests for section coordination
4. Test human feedback processing with various scenarios
5. Verify export functionality with different formats
6. Test recovery from interrupted states
7. Create performance benchmarks for different proposal sizes
8. Test timeline adherence and adjustment
9. Verify quality assurance with intentionally flawed inputs
