# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Agent Monitoring and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools

# Details:
Develop a robust monitoring and observability system for the agent framework that provides real-time visibility into agent operations, performance metrics, and error conditions. This system should enable developers and operators to effectively debug, optimize, and maintain agent workflows.

## Key Components:

1. **Agent Execution Tracing**:
   - Implement detailed trace logging
   - Create visual trace inspection tools
   - Add trace search and filtering
   - Implement trace comparison features
   - Create execution timeline visualization
   - Add trace annotation capabilities

2. **State Monitoring**:
   - Implement state change tracking
   - Create state diff visualization
   - Add state snapshots at key points
   - Implement state history navigation
   - Create state schema validation
   - Add state size monitoring

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Create node execution time tracking
   - Implement LLM token usage monitoring
   - Add memory usage tracking
   - Create throughput measurement
   - Implement queue length monitoring
   - Add latency tracking across nodes

4. **Error Detection and Handling**:
   - Implement error classification
   - Create error trend analysis
   - Add automatic error notification
   - Implement error correlation
   - Create error reproduction tools
   - Add failure pattern detection

5. **Logging Infrastructure**:
   - Create structured logging system
   - Implement log aggregation
   - Add log retention policies
   - Create log search capabilities
   - Implement log level control
   - Add context-aware logging

6. **Visualization and Dashboards**:
   - Create agent workflow dashboards
   - Implement real-time monitoring UI
   - Add performance visualization
   - Create error rate dashboards
   - Implement state transition visualizers
   - Add system health indicators

7. **Alerting System**:
   - Implement threshold-based alerts
   - Create anomaly detection alerts
   - Add SLA breach notifications
   - Implement error rate alerts
   - Create resource usage warnings
   - Add custom alert definitions

8. **Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Create interactive debugging console
   - Implement node inspection tools
   - Add state manipulation utilities
   - Create execution playback
   - Implement chain testing tools
   - Add performance profiling

## Implementation Guidelines:

- The monitoring system should have minimal impact on agent performance
- All components should be designed for both development and production use
- Visualization tools should provide both overview and detailed views
- Alerting should be configurable to prevent alert fatigue
- Diagnostic tools should enable rapid problem identification and resolution
- The system should support both real-time and historical analysis
- Privacy considerations should be built in, especially for sensitive data
- Integration with existing monitoring tools should be supported

## Expected Outcomes:

- Comprehensive visibility into agent operations
- Faster debugging and issue resolution
- Proactive detection of potential problems
- Better understanding of agent performance characteristics
- Improved agent reliability through early issue detection
- Enhanced ability to optimize agent workflows
- Better transparency for stakeholders

# Test Strategy:
1. Test monitoring impact on agent performance
2. Verify accuracy of collected metrics
3. Test visualization tools under various conditions
4. Verify alert triggering and delivery
5. Test diagnostic tools with common issues
6. Create stress tests to verify monitoring resilience
7. Test historical data retention and retrieval
8. Verify integration with external monitoring systems
9. Test monitoring of complex multi-agent workflows
10. Verify privacy controls and data protection
