# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Human-in-the-Loop Interaction Patterns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create standardized patterns for human feedback and intervention points

# Details:
Develop a comprehensive set of standardized patterns and components for human-in-the-loop interactions within the agent system. These patterns should enable effective human feedback, intervention, and collaboration at various points in the agent workflow.

## Key Components:

1. **Interaction Types**:
   - Implement approval/rejection patterns
   - Create feedback collection interfaces
   - Add correction submission flows
   - Implement suggestion review mechanisms
   - Add direct editing capabilities
   - Create branching decision points

2. **UI Components**:
   - Develop approval dialogs
   - Create feedback forms
   - Implement correction interfaces
   - Add suggestion review UIs
   - Create direct editing components
   - Implement decision interfaces

3. **State Management**:
   - Create interaction state tracking
   - Implement feedback incorporation
   - Add interaction history
   - Create state rollback capabilities
   - Implement multiple version management
   - Add checkpoint creation

4. **Notification System**:
   - Implement human task notifications
   - Create timeout alerts
   - Add completion notifications
   - Implement review request system
   - Create urgent intervention alerts
   - Add progress updates

5. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Create standard waiting nodes
   - Implement feedback processing nodes
   - Add decision routing nodes
   - Create state integration utilities
   - Implement interaction logging
   - Add recovery mechanisms

6. **Asynchronous Interactions**:
   - Implement email notification integration
   - Create mobile notification capabilities
   - Add webhook triggers
   - Create scheduled reviews
   - Implement batch operations
   - Add delayed feedback handling

7. **Permission Management**:
   - Create role-based interaction controls
   - Implement multi-reviewer capabilities
   - Add delegation mechanisms
   - Create escalation paths
   - Implement approval chains
   - Add audit logging

8. **Analytics & Improvement**:
   - Create interaction tracking
   - Implement feedback analysis tools
   - Add improvement suggestion generation
   - Create intervention pattern detection
   - Implement bottleneck identification
   - Add user satisfaction measurement

## Implementation Guidelines:

- All interaction patterns should be implemented as reusable components that can be integrated into any subgraph
- State management should handle interruptions and multi-user scenarios gracefully
- UI components should be responsive and accessible
- Interactions should be streamlined to minimize cognitive load
- Feedback should be contextual and specific to the relevant part of the workflow
- History tracking should enable tracing decisions back to specific human inputs
- Timeout and escalation mechanisms should prevent blocked workflows
- All interactions should be monitored for performance and user satisfaction

## Expected Outcomes:

- A library of reusable interaction patterns and components
- Standardized approach to human-in-the-loop interactions across the system
- Improved agent reliability through targeted human interventions
- Enhanced user experience through contextual feedback mechanisms
- Reduced agent errors through timely human corrections
- Better workflow visibility and control for human operators
- Continuous improvement through interaction analysis

# Test Strategy:
1. Create test cases for each interaction pattern
2. Test feedback incorporation in state transitions
3. Verify notification delivery across channels
4. Test permission-based access controls
5. Create UI component test suites
6. Test asynchronous interaction patterns
7. Verify analytics data collection
8. Test recovery from interrupted interactions
9. Create end-to-end tests for common scenarios
10. Test performance under various conditions
