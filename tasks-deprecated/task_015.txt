# Task ID: 15
# Title: Build Performance Optimization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize state management and LLM usage for efficiency
# Details:
Implement efficient state serialization to minimize storage requirements. Create strategic checkpointing to reduce database load. Implement message filtering and prioritization for LLM context management. Configure appropriate recursion limits to prevent infinite loops. Utilize LangGraph features for optimized context window management. Implement streaming patterns for efficient state updates. Add fallback strategies for performance degradation scenarios.

# Test Strategy:
Measure storage requirements before and after optimization. Test context window utilization with various message histories. Verify prevention of infinite recursion with complex graphs. Validate context window management optimizations. Test streaming performance under load. Verify fallback strategies during performance degradation.
