# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Persistent Storage for Agent State
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust persistence layer for agent state

# Details:
Develop a comprehensive persistence system for LangGraph agent state that enables reliable storage, retrieval, and management of agent execution state across sessions. This system should support interruption, resumption, and long-running workflows while maintaining consistency and performance.

## Key Components:

1. **State Serialization**:
   - Implement efficient JSON serialization
   - Create binary serialization for large states
   - Add compression for state storage
   - Implement partial state serialization
   - Create custom serializers for complex objects
   - Add schema versioning support

2. **Storage Backends**:
   - Implement Supabase integration
   - Create file system storage option
   - Add Redis support for caching
   - Implement S3/cloud storage option
   - Create hybrid storage strategy
   - Add backup and recovery mechanisms

3. **Checkpoint Management**:
   - Implement automatic checkpointing
   - Create manual checkpoint triggers
   - Add checkpoint verification
   - Implement checkpoint browsing UI
   - Create checkpoint comparison tools
   - Add checkpoint pruning strategies

4. **State Migration**:
   - Create schema migration tools
   - Implement version compatibility checks
   - Add state upgrade pathways
   - Create state downgrade support
   - Implement migration testing framework
   - Add schema documentation generation

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Create partial state updates
   - Add background synchronization
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Create batch operations
   - Add storage compression

6. **Consistency & Recovery**:
   - Implement transaction support
   - Create conflict resolution
   - Add rollback capabilities
   - Implement crash recovery
   - Create consistency verification
   - Add automatic repair tools

7. **Security**:
   - Implement encryption at rest
   - Create access control
   - Add audit logging
   - Implement sensitive data handling
   - Create compliance features
   - Add security testing framework

## Implementation Guidelines:

- The persistence system should be configurable for different use cases
- State serialization should handle complex object types including functions
- Storage backends should be pluggable with a consistent interface
- Performance should be optimized for both write and read operations
- Security measures should be integrated throughout the system
- The system should provide clear error messages and recovery paths
- Testing should cover edge cases, large states, and failure scenarios
- Documentation should be comprehensive for both users and contributors

## Expected Outcomes:

- Reliable persistence of agent state across sessions
- Support for long-running agent workflows
- Improved resilience against failures and interruptions
- Efficient storage and retrieval of large state objects
- Secure handling of sensitive information
- Flexible storage options for different deployment scenarios
- Clear migration paths for schema evolution
- Comprehensive monitoring and management tools

# Test Strategy:
1. Test serialization with various complex state objects
2. Verify performance under high load conditions
3. Test recovery from simulated failures
4. Verify security measures with penetration testing
5. Test migration across schema versions
6. Create benchmarks for storage operations
7. Test with extremely large state objects
8. Verify consistency across storage backends
9. Test checkpoint management functionality
10. Create integration tests with full agent workflows
