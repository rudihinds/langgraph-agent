# Task ID: 21
# Title: RFP Document Analysis and Extraction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create NLP pipeline to analyze RFP documents and extract key information

# Details:
Develop a comprehensive NLP pipeline that can process various RFP document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.), extract structured information, and convert unstructured requirements into structured data for agent consumption. This system will serve as the foundation for understanding client needs and requirements accurately.

## Key Components:

1. **Document Parsing and Preprocessing**:
   - Implement multi-format document parsing (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML)
   - Create layout analysis for structured documents
   - Implement text normalization and cleaning
   - Add language detection and multilingual support
   - Create section identification and categorization
   - Implement table and chart extraction

2. **Entity Recognition and Extraction**:
   - Identify organizations, personnel, and roles
   - Extract dates, deadlines, and timeframes
   - Recognize financial information and budgets
   - Identify technical requirements and specifications
   - Extract evaluation criteria and scoring mechanisms
   - Recognize compliance requirements

3. **Requirement Classification**:
   - Categorize requirements by type (functional, non-functional, etc.)
   - Implement priority inference for requirements
   - Add interdependency detection between requirements
   - Create implicit vs. explicit requirement classification
   - Implement requirement deduplication
   - Add ambiguity detection in requirements

4. **Information Structuring**:
   - Convert requirements to structured format
   - Create semantic linking between related information
   - Implement requirement normalization
   - Add contextual enrichment of requirements
   - Create hierarchical organization of information
   - Implement confidence scoring for extractions

5. **Document Understanding**:
   - Extract project scope and objectives
   - Identify client background and context
   - Recognize industry-specific terminology
   - Implement competitive landscape analysis
   - Create executive summary generation
   - Add implicit need identification

6. **Export and Integration**:
   - Create standardized output format for agents
   - Implement progressive information enrichment
   - Add manual review and correction interface
   - Create version control for processed documents
   - Implement incremental processing for large documents
   - Add integration with knowledge graph system

7. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for parsed documents
   - Create batch processing for multiple documents
   - Add asynchronous processing pipeline
   - Implement priority-based processing queue
   - Create resource usage monitoring
   - Add performance analytics and logging

## Implementation Guidelines:

- The system should prioritize accuracy over processing speed
- Document parsing should maintain original formatting where relevant
- Entity recognition should adapt to domain-specific terminology
- Requirement classification should use consistent taxonomies
- Information structuring should preserve the original context
- Document understanding should identify both explicit and implicit needs
- Export formats should be versioned and backward compatible
- Manual review should be minimized but available for complex documents
- Performance optimizations should target both speed and resource usage

## Expected Outcomes:

- Reduced manual effort in RFP analysis through automated extraction
- More consistent interpretation of requirements across different agents
- Improved requirement traceability through structured representation
- Enhanced proposal completeness through comprehensive requirement capture
- Reduced risk of missing critical requirements or deadlines
- More efficient proposal planning through early requirement analysis
- Better alignment with client needs through systematic extraction
- Improved competitive positioning through thorough requirement understanding
- Enhanced quality control through structured requirement representation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test document parsing with diverse RFP formats
2. Verify entity extraction accuracy with annotated documents
3. Test requirement classification with domain-specific examples
4. Verify information structuring with complex requirements
5. Test document understanding with ambiguous RFPs
6. Create integration tests with agent consumption workflows
7. Verify performance with large and complex documents
8. Test error handling with malformed or incomplete documents
9. Create benchmark tests for processing speed optimization
10. Test multilingual support with non-English RFPs
