# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Solution Sought Agent Subgraph
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build agent for determining specific solution requirements
# Details:
Implement the Solution Sought Agent subgraph to determine specific solution requirements based on RFP and research. Create nodes for analyzing preferred approaches, identifying unwanted methodologies, and generating a structured solution framework. Utilize LangGraph features for context window management when processing large documents. Implement streaming patterns for returning solution analysis results. Add fallback strategies for API failures during solution analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various RFP scenarios to verify correct identification of solution requirements. Verify proper detection of preferred and unwanted approaches. Test generation of solution frameworks. Validate context window management with large documents. Test streaming of analysis results. Verify fallback strategies during simulated API failures.
