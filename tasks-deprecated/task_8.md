# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Proposal Manager Agent with Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the coordinator for section generation with dependency tracking

# Details:
Create the Proposal Manager Agent to coordinate section generation with dependency awareness. This agent will manage the generation of proposal sections in the correct order based on dependencies, handle scheduling, and implement map-reduce patterns for parallel processing where possible.

Key components to implement:

1. **Proposal Manager Agent Structure**:
   - Create the proposal manager state annotation extending the proposal state
   - Implement the main proposal manager subgraph with appropriate nodes
   - Define interfaces for orchestrator integration
   - Create entry and exit points with proper state transformations

2. **Section Dependency Graph**:
   - Implement directed graph for section dependencies
   - Create topological sorting algorithm for section order
   - Add cycle detection and resolution
   - Implement optional dependency support

3. **Scheduling Logic**:
   - Create scheduling algorithm based on dependencies
   - Implement priority-based scheduling for critical sections
   - Add parallel processing for independent sections
   - Create timeout handling for long-running generations

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Implement section completion tracking
   - Create percentage-based progress calculation
   - Add estimated time remaining functionality
   - Implement checkpoint verification for completed sections

5. **Section Generator Coordination**:
   - Create interfaces for all section generators
   - Implement proper state transformations between generators
   - Add result validation for generated sections
   - Create consistency checking across sections

6. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Implement map-reduce patterns for parallel generation
   - Create aggregation nodes for combining parallel results
   - Add synchronization mechanisms for dependent sections
   - Implement load balancing for generation tasks

7. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**:
   - Implement interruption points for section review
   - Add feedback incorporation with dependency impact analysis
   - Create modification support for generated sections
   - Implement re-generation triggers based on feedback

Default section dependencies should follow:
- Executive Summary: depends on all other sections
- Problem Statement: depends on research findings
- Solution: depends on problem statement and solution sought analysis
- Organizational Capacity: depends on connection pairs
- Implementation Plan: depends on solution
- Evaluation Approach: depends on implementation plan
- Budget: depends on implementation plan
- Conclusion: depends on all other sections

The workflow should follow:
1. Build dependency graph based on section relationships
2. Determine optimal generation order
3. Schedule and execute section generation in proper order
4. Track progress and handle completions
5. Collect human feedback at appropriate points
6. Re-generate sections as needed
7. Finalize all sections and update proposal state

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for dependency graph with various section relationships
2. Test topological sorting with different dependency scenarios
3. Verify scheduling logic with mixed priority sections
4. Test progress tracking with simulated section completions
5. Verify parallel processing with independent sections
6. Test human feedback incorporation with dependency impact
7. Create integration tests with section generators
8. Verify proper state transformations throughout the proposal generation flow
