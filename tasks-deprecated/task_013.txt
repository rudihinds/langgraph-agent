# Title: Develop API Integration for Frontend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create APIs for frontend integration with the agent system
# Details:
Expose state updates via structured API endpoints. Implement streaming capability for real-time updates. Create endpoints for interruption and resumption. Implement time-travel capability with UI representation using checkpoint history. Utilize LangGraph features for context window management when streaming large state updates. Implement streaming patterns for continuous frontend updates. Add fallback strategies for API communication failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test API endpoints with sample requests. Verify proper streaming of updates. Test interrupt and resume functionality via API. Test time-travel navigation with checkpoint history. Validate context window management for large state updates. Test streaming of frontend updates. Verify fallback strategies during API communication failures.
