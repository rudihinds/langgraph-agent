# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Proposal Research Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement an agent that researches and extracts information from RFP documents

# Details:
Implement a specialized Proposal Research Agent responsible for analyzing RFP documents, extracting critical information, and preparing research materials that will inform the generation of all proposal sections. This agent will serve as a key dependency for the Proposal Manager Agent and section generators.

Key components to implement:

1. **Document Analysis Subgraph**:
   - Create nodes for processing PDF, Word, and text documents
   - Implement text extraction with formatting awareness
   - Add section identification and hierarchical structure extraction
   - Create metadata extraction (dates, funding amounts, eligibility)
   - Implement requirement identification and categorization

2. **Funder Analysis Subgraph**:
   - Create funder identification nodes
   - Implement priority extraction from RFP language
   - Add value alignment analysis
   - Create funding history analysis
   - Implement successful proposal pattern identification

3. **Requirement Extraction**:
   - Implement explicit requirement identification
   - Create implicit requirement inference
   - Add eligibility criteria extraction
   - Implement submission guideline extraction
   - Create evaluation criteria analysis

4. **Structured Knowledge Base**:
   - Create knowledge structures for extracted information
   - Implement cross-reference system for related information
   - Add confidence scoring for extracted facts
   - Create retrieval system for section generators
   - Implement vector embedding for semantic search

5. **Research Vector Database**:
   - Create vector storage for research findings
   - Implement semantic search capabilities
   - Add automatic categorization of research items
   - Create relevance scoring for search results
   - Implement update mechanisms for new findings

6. **External Research Integration**:
   - Create nodes for relevant web research
   - Implement selective external data integration
   - Add citation tracking and management
   - Create evidence quality assessment
   - Implement alignment checking with RFP

7. **Research Summary Generation**:
   - Implement executive brief creation for human review
   - Create key findings extraction for quick review
   - Add gap identification for additional research needs
   - Implement recommendation generation for proposal approach
   - Create visual summary capabilities (charts, tables)

8. **Human-in-the-Loop Research Refinement**:
   - Create interfaces for human feedback on research
   - Implement priority adjustment based on feedback
   - Add follow-up question generation
   - Create research refinement based on human input
   - Implement progressive disclosure of research details

The Research Agent should support the following workflow:
1. Ingest RFP documents in various formats
2. Extract and structure key information
3. Identify explicit and implicit requirements
4. Analyze funder priorities and preferences
5. Generate a comprehensive research summary
6. Store findings in a queryable knowledge base
7. Present key insights for human review and refinement
8. Make research available to section generators

Research output should be structured to support each proposal section with:
- Relevant requirements and guidelines
- Funder priorities related to that section
- Supporting evidence and facts
- Comparative information from successful proposals
- Potential approaches and strategies

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each analysis node with various document types
2. Test extraction accuracy against annotated RFP documents
3. Verify knowledge base creation and retrieval functionality
4. Test semantic search with various query types
5. Create integration tests with the Proposal Manager agent
6. Test human feedback incorporation
7. Benchmark extraction quality against manual analysis
8. Test adaptation to different funding domains (government, foundation, corporate)
9. Verify citation and reference handling
