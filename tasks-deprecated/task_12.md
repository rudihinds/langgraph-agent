# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement State Management for Agent Persistence
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust state management system to enable agent persistence and checkpointing

# Details:
Implement a comprehensive state management system that enables agent persistence, checkpointing, and recovery across sessions. This system should allow agents to maintain context, resume interrupted tasks, and handle complex workflows that may span multiple user sessions.

Key components to implement:

1. **State Schema Definition**:
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for all state types
   - Implement Zod validation schemas
   - Add serialization/deserialization functions
   - Create state version tracking for migrations
   - Implement state compression strategies
   - Add state integrity verification

2. **Checkpoint System**:
   - Create checkpoint creation mechanism
   - Implement configurable checkpoint frequency
   - Add incremental and full checkpoint options
   - Create checkpoint metadata tracking
   - Implement checkpoint validation
   - Add checkpoint pruning strategies

3. **Persistence Layer**:
   - Create Supabase state storage implementation
   - Implement transaction handling for atomicity
   - Add fallback storage mechanisms
   - Create encrypted state storage option
   - Implement read/write optimizations
   - Add batch operations for efficiency

4. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Create state recovery from checkpoints
   - Implement error handling during recovery
   - Add partial recovery capabilities
   - Create state repair functions
   - Implement recovery logging
   - Add automatic recovery testing

5. **State Transition Management**:
   - Create safe state transition helpers
   - Implement transaction-like state updates
   - Add state history tracking
   - Create rollback capabilities
   - Implement state branching (for exploring multiple approaches)
   - Add merge functionality for parallel states

6. **State Access Controls**:
   - Create role-based access control for state
   - Implement state sharing capabilities
   - Add multi-user collaborative state
   - Create state audit trails
   - Implement state locking mechanisms
   - Add concurrency control

7. **State Optimization**:
   - Create pruning strategies for large histories
   - Implement selective state persistence
   - Add compression for large state objects
   - Create context window management
   - Implement token usage optimization
   - Add streaming state updates

8. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Create state visualization tools
   - Implement state diff utilities
   - Add state snapshot export/import
   - Create time-travel debugging
   - Implement state inspection API
   - Add state metric collection

This state management system should work seamlessly with LangGraph's state handling while providing additional capabilities for long-running agents. It should be designed to handle large state objects that may include:

- Message history and conversation context
- Generated content in various stages
- External research data and references
- User preferences and feedback
- Generation parameters and configurations
- Timeline and progress tracking

The system should minimize state size while preserving critical context, support different persistence frequencies based on agent activity, and handle failures gracefully with appropriate recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for state serialization/deserialization
2. Test checkpoint creation and recovery with large states
3. Create integration tests with actual agent workflows
4. Test concurrent access patterns and conflict resolution
5. Verify performance with realistic state sizes
6. Test recovery from simulated failures
7. Create stress tests for large state objects
8. Test state migration between versions
9. Verify security of persisted state
10. Create benchmarks for state operations
