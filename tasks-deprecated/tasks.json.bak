Modify the StateGraph to include explicit terminal nodes for success, failure, and timeout conditions\n3. Implement conditional edges that direct workflow to terminal states when completion criteria are met\n4. Update the orchestrator prompt template to include directives about recognizing completion criteria\n5. Add state validation functions that can determine if the current state represents a completed workflow\n\nTesting approach:\n- Create test workflows with known completion conditions\n- Verify that the orchestrator correctly identifies and transitions to terminal states\n- Test edge cases where completion is ambiguous\n- Ensure all terminal states properly clean up resources",

Add similarity metrics to detect when states are effectively equivalent even if not identical\n5. Integrate the loop detection with the completion criteria from subtask 1 to trigger termination when loops are detected\n6. Add detailed logging of state transitions and loop detection events\n\nTesting approach:\n- Create test workflows that intentionally contain loops\n- Verify that the system detects both exact and similar state repetitions\n- Test with varying thresholds for loop detection sensitivity\n- Ensure performance remains acceptable when tracking long execution histories",
