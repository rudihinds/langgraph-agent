# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Persistence Layer with Checkpointing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement checkpoint-based persistence using Supabase

# Details:
Create a PostgresCheckpointer class that integrates with Supabase for persistent storage of agent state. This is critical for maintaining proposal sessions across user interactions and enabling resumption of work.

Implement the following components:
1. **PostgresCheckpointer Class**:
   - Implements the Checkpointer interface from LangGraph
   - Connects to Supabase PostgreSQL database
   - Handles serialization and deserialization of state
   - Manages thread-based organization for proposals

2. **Thread Management**:
   - Create a consistent thread ID format for proposals (e.g., `proposal_{uuid}`)
   - Implement methods to create, list, and delete threads
   - Add functionality to list checkpoints within a thread

3. **Checkpoint Operations**:
   - Implement save_checkpoint method for storing state snapshots
   - Create get_checkpoint method for retrieving specific checkpoints
   - Implement list_checkpoints for viewing available checkpoints
   - Add functionality for checkpoint pruning/cleanup

4. **Serialization Utilities**:
   - Create serializers for complex state objects
   - Implement deserializers for reconstructing state
   - Handle circular references in state objects
   - Add compression for large state objects

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry logic for database operations
   - Add logging for persistence operations
   - Create error classification for different failure types
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for partial failures

6. **Session Management**:
   - Add methods for session timeout handling
   - Implement active session tracking
   - Create utilities for session recovery
   - Add hooks for session events (create, resume, end)

7. **Supabase Client Management**:
   - Implement connection pooling for Supabase client
   - Add environment-based configuration
   - Create connection health checking
   - Implement graceful shutdown handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for serialization/deserialization of complex state
2. Test checkpoint save and load with representative state objects
3. Verify thread management functionality with multiple threads
4. Test error handling during database operations with simulated failures
5. Benchmark performance with large state objects
6. Verify session recovery after simulated crashes
7. Test concurrency with multiple simultaneous checkpoint operations
8. Create integration tests with actual Supabase instance
