# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Multi-Agent Coordination System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create framework for multiple specialized agents to collaborate

# Details:
Design and implement a multi-agent coordination system that enables specialized agents to collaborate on complex proposal generation tasks. This system should support effective communication, task delegation, conflict resolution, and knowledge sharing between agents, with a focus on producing high-quality outputs through distributed expertise.

## Key Components:

1. **Agent Registry and Discovery**:
   - Create agent capability descriptions
   - Implement dynamic agent registration
   - Add capability-based discovery
   - Create versioning for agent interfaces
   - Implement agent health monitoring
   - Add capability verification

2. **Communication Protocols**:
   - Design standardized message formats
   - Implement synchronous and asynchronous messaging
   - Create broadcast capabilities
   - Add targeted communication
   - Implement secure channels
   - Create communication logging

3. **Task Orchestration**:
   - Implement task decomposition
   - Create dependency management
   - Add task allocation algorithms
   - Implement priority-based scheduling
   - Create progress tracking
   - Add dynamic reallocation

4. **Knowledge Sharing**:
   - Implement shared context storage
   - Create standardized knowledge formats
   - Add progressive knowledge building
   - Implement contradiction detection
   - Create relevance filtering
   - Add knowledge provenance tracking

5. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Implement conflict detection
   - Create resolution strategies
   - Add voting mechanisms
   - Implement expert escalation
   - Create confidence weighting
   - Add audit trails for decisions

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement parallel processing
   - Create load balancing
   - Add caching mechanisms
   - Implement batched operations
   - Create resource allocation
   - Add performance metrics

7. **Coordination Patterns**:
   - Implement manager-worker patterns
   - Create peer collaboration
   - Add specialist consultation
   - Implement hierarchical coordination
   - Create market-based allocation
   - Add team formation

## Implementation Guidelines:

- The system should support both tight and loose coupling between agents
- Communication should be efficient and minimize redundant messages
- Task allocation should optimize for agent specialization and load balance
- Knowledge sharing should maintain consistency across the agent network
- Conflict resolution should prioritize output quality over speed
- The system should be resilient to individual agent failures
- Coordination patterns should be adaptable to different workflow requirements
- Performance optimization should scale with increasing agent count

## Expected Outcomes:

- Improved output quality through specialized agent collaboration
- Enhanced proposal completeness through diverse expertise
- Reduced processing time through parallel task execution
- Consistent knowledge application across proposal sections
- Graceful handling of conflicting approaches or information
- Optimal resource utilization across the agent network
- Transparent tracking of contributions and decisions
- Scalable performance with increasing workflow complexity

# Test Strategy:
1. Test agent registration and discovery with diverse capabilities
2. Verify communication between agents with various message types
3. Test task allocation with simulated workloads
4. Verify knowledge sharing consistency across agents
5. Test conflict resolution with engineered conflicts
6. Create performance benchmarks for varying agent counts
7. Test resilience with simulated agent failures
8. Verify coordination pattern effectiveness for proposal tasks
9. Test scalability with complex workflows
10. Create integration tests for end-to-end proposal generation
