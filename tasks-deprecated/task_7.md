# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Connection Pairs Agent Subgraph
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement agent for identifying alignment between applicant and funder

# Details:
Develop the Connection Pairs Agent subgraph to analyze applicant capabilities against funder priorities and generate specific alignment points. This agent will identify strategic connections, provide evidence for each alignment, and rank connections by strength and relevance.

Key components to implement:

1. **Connection Pairs Agent Structure**:
   - Create the connection pairs state annotation extending the proposal state
   - Implement the main connection pairs subgraph with appropriate nodes
   - Define interfaces for orchestrator integration
   - Create entry and exit points with proper state transformations

2. **Applicant Analysis**:
   - Implement capabilities extraction from applicant information
   - Create experience categorization mechanisms
   - Add strength and weakness detection
   - Implement unique selling point identification

3. **Funder Priority Mapping**:
   - Create structured representation of funder priorities
   - Implement implicit priority detection from research
   - Add weight assignment for different priorities
   - Create contextual understanding of priority importance

4. **Alignment Detection**:
   - Implement semantic matching between capabilities and priorities
   - Create pattern recognition for non-obvious connections
   - Add evidence collection for each potential connection
   - Implement connection strength scoring

5. **Connection Pair Generation**:
   - Create structured connection pair format
   - Implement evidence linking for each connection
   - Add concise rationale generation
   - Create prioritization mechanism based on strength

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**:
   - Implement feedback collection for connection pairs
   - Add rejection handling with alternatives generation
   - Create modification support for connections
   - Implement connection editing functionality

The connection pair format should include:
- Applicant capability/strength
- Funder priority/interest
- Connection strength score (1-10)
- Evidence supporting the connection
- Rationale explaining the strategic importance

The workflow should follow:
1. Analyze applicant information to extract capabilities
2. Map funder priorities from research and solution requirements
3. Identify potential alignment points between the two
4. Generate evidence and rationale for each connection
5. Score and prioritize connections by strength
6. Present for human feedback and incorporate revisions
7. Finalize and store in the proposal state

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for applicant capability extraction
2. Test funder priority mapping with different research inputs
3. Verify alignment detection with various capability/priority combinations
4. Test connection strength scoring with different evidence types
5. Verify prioritization logic for diverse connection sets
6. Test human feedback incorporation with different feedback types
7. Create integration tests with the solution agent
8. Verify proper state transformations during the connection generation flow
