# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Draft Section Generator Agents
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create agents for generating individual proposal sections

# Details:
Develop specialized generator agents for each proposal section, implementing a consistent interface while tailoring the generation approach to the specific needs of each section type. These agents will work together with the Proposal Manager to create a complete proposal document.

Key components to implement:

1. **Base Section Generator Interface**:
   - Define common section generator interface for all sections
   - Create base state annotation extending the proposal state
   - Implement standard input/output contracts for all generators
   - Build common utilities for section formatting and styling

2. **Executive Summary Generator**:
   - Implement specialized prompting for concise summaries
   - Create algorithms for extracting key points from other sections
   - Add conclusion generation focused on impact and alignment
   - Implement length control and formatting specific to exec summaries

3. **Problem Statement Generator**:
   - Create analysis nodes for breaking down research findings
   - Implement framing utilities to align with funder priorities
   - Add evidence integration from research data
   - Implement urgent need articulation and societal impact

4. **Solution Generator**:
   - Implement detailed solution description based on solution framework
   - Create innovation highlighting for unique approaches
   - Add alignment demonstration with funder priorities
   - Implement outcome projection and impact claims

5. **Organizational Capacity Generator**:
   - Create expertise presentation from connection pairs
   - Implement track record evidence integration
   - Add team qualification highlight generation
   - Create infrastructure and resource description

6. **Implementation Plan Generator**:
   - Implement timeline creation with milestones
   - Create activity breakdown with responsibilities
   - Add risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Implement resource allocation planning

7. **Evaluation Approach Generator**:
   - Create metrics and KPI generation
   - Implement evaluation methodology description
   - Add reporting plan generation
   - Create continuous improvement framework

8. **Budget Generator**:
   - Implement line item extraction from implementation plan
   - Create budget justification generation
   - Add cost-effectiveness demonstration
   - Implement budget table formatting

9. **Conclusion Generator**:
   - Create impact summary focusing on outcomes
   - Implement lasting change articulation
   - Add partnership value proposition
   - Create compelling final statements

10. **Section Consistency Tools**:
    - Implement cross-section reference management
    - Create terminology consistency checking
    - Add style and tone normalization
    - Implement numeric consistency validation

Each section generator should:
- Consume the appropriate dependencies from the proposal state
- Generate content tailored to the specific section requirements
- Format according to common proposal standards
- Include appropriate citations and evidence
- Maintain consistency with other sections
- Support regeneration with human feedback

The workflow for each generator should follow:
1. Read required dependencies and research from proposal state
2. Plan the section content based on funder preferences
3. Generate initial draft with appropriate subsections
4. Check consistency with dependencies and other sections
5. Present for human review and incorporate feedback
6. Finalize and store in the proposal state

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each section generator with various inputs
2. Test dependency handling with mock proposal state
3. Verify formatting and style consistency across sections
4. Test regeneration with simulated human feedback
5. Benchmark generation quality against example proposals
6. Test edge cases with limited or conflicting input data
7. Verify cross-section reference handling
8. Create integration tests with the Proposal Manager agent
