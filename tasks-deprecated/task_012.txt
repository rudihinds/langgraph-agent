# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement LLM Integration and Optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure and optimize LLM usage across the agent system
# Details:
Implement integration with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4o-mini for appropriate tasks. Create context window management with conversation summarization. Implement streaming functionality for real-time feedback. Develop fallback strategies for model failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test context window management with long conversations. Verify proper streaming of outputs. Test fallback mechanisms during simulated failures. Measure token usage efficiency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure LLM API Clients and Service Abstraction [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a unified service layer for multiple LLM providers (Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-o3-mini, and GPT-4o-mini) with appropriate client configurations and provider selection logic.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create API client configurations for each LLM provider (Claude and OpenAI)
2. Implement a provider-agnostic LLMService interface with common methods (generateText, generateChat, etc.)
3. Create concrete implementations for each provider (ClaudeService, OpenAIService)
4. Implement a factory/selector pattern to choose the appropriate model based on task requirements
5. Add error handling, retry logic, and timeout configurations
6. Create unit tests with mocked API responses
7. Integration test with each provider using small prompt examples

Testing approach:
- Unit test the abstraction layer with mocked responses
- Test error handling with simulated failures
- Create an integration test suite with minimal prompts to verify actual API connectivity
- Benchmark response times and token usage for different providers

## 2. Develop Context Window Management with Conversation Summarization [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create a system to manage conversation history within LLM context windows, including dynamic summarization to optimize token usage while preserving important context.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a ConversationManager class to track message history
2. Implement token counting for different model providers
3. Add configuration for maximum context window sizes per model
4. Create a summarization strategy that triggers when context approaches window limits
5. Implement conversation pruning logic to remove less relevant messages
6. Develop conversation state persistence for long-running interactions
7. Add metadata tracking for message importance/relevance

Testing approach:
- Unit test token counting accuracy across different models
- Test summarization with sample conversations of increasing length
- Create scenarios that trigger window management and verify context preservation
- Verify that critical information is maintained after summarization
- Benchmark token usage before and after optimization

## 3. Implement Streaming Functionality for Real-time Responses [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Add streaming capabilities to the LLM service layer to provide real-time token-by-token responses and implement fallback strategies for model failures.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the LLMService interface to support streaming responses
2. Implement streaming for each provider (Claude and OpenAI streaming APIs)
3. Create event handlers/callbacks for token streaming
4. Develop a UI/output component to display streaming responses
5. Implement cancellation support for ongoing requests
6. Create fallback strategies for model failures (retry with different model, graceful degradation)
7. Add monitoring and logging for streaming performance
8. Implement circuit breaker pattern for unreliable models

Testing approach:
- Test streaming with progressively complex prompts
- Verify cancellation works correctly mid-stream
- Simulate network failures to test fallback strategies
- Measure latency to first token and token throughput
- Load test with multiple simultaneous streaming requests
- Verify graceful degradation when primary models are unavailable
