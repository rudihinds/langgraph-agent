# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Evaluation Agent with Feedback Loop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build evaluation capabilities with iterative improvement
# Details:
Implement the Evaluation Agent to assess content quality against defined criteria. Create evaluator-optimizer pattern for iterative improvement. Implement quality metrics for alignment, adherence to requirements, evidence quality, and overall coherence. Utilize LangGraph features for context window management when evaluating large proposals. Implement streaming patterns for evaluation feedback. Add fallback strategies for API failures during evaluation operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test evaluation of sample sections against criteria. Verify feedback generation for improvement. Test iterative improvement over multiple evaluation cycles. Validate context window management with large proposal content. Test streaming of evaluation results. Verify fallback strategies during simulated API failures.
