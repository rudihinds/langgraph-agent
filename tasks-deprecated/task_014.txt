# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Error Handling and Resilience System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement essential error handling for launch across the agent system
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Node-Level Retry and Resilience Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for LLM calls and external API interactions
### Details:


## 2. Create Core Error Classification System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive system to classify errors by type and source to apply appropriate handling strategies
### Details:


## 3. Implement Basic Checkpoint Recovery for Failures [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Create essential mechanisms for state preservation and recovery after failures
### Details:
Implemented a comprehensive checkpoint recovery system for LangGraph workflows that integrates with error handling and monitoring. The implementation includes configurable checkpoint recovery mechanism that works with PostgresCheckpointer, support for various recoverable error categories with customizable handlers, node-level checkpoint-aware functionality for fine-grained state preservation, monitoring integration to track recovery attempts and success rates, manual and automatic recovery capabilities with proper error propagation, hooks for custom recovery logic via callback functions, and comprehensive documentation with example implementation. The system ensures workflows can reliably recover from various failure conditions by leveraging checkpoints, reducing data loss and improving resilience.
