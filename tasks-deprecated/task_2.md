# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core State Annotations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the state management foundation with appropriate annotations and reducers

# Details:
Implement the ProposalStateAnnotation with appropriate reducers for all state components as defined in the PRD. This is a foundational task for the entire agent system as all agents will rely on this state schema.

Create the following state components:
1. **ProposalStateAnnotation** - Root annotation containing all sub-annotations
2. **MessagesAnnotation** - For storing conversation history
3. **RfpDocumentAnnotation** - For storing parsed RFP document
4. **FunderInfoAnnotation** - For storing research data about the funder
5. **SolutionSoughtAnnotation** - For storing solution requirements
6. **ConnectionPairsAnnotation** - For storing alignment points with reducer for adding new pairs
7. **ProposalSectionsAnnotation** - For storing generated content with section-specific reducers
8. **SectionDependenciesAnnotation** - For tracking dependencies between sections
9. **EvaluationHistoryAnnotation** - For tracking evaluation results with append reducer

Implementation should include:
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all state components
- Efficient reducers that follow immutability principles
- Default values for all annotation types
- Appropriate comments explaining the purpose of each annotation
- Proper namespace management for annotation keys

Example implementation from the PRD:
```typescript
const ProposalStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
 messages: Annotation<BaseMessage[]>({
   reducer: messagesStateReducer,
   default: () => [],
 }),
 rfpDocument: Annotation<Document>,
 funderInfo: Annotation<ResearchData>,
 solutionSought: Annotation<SolutionRequirements>,
 connectionPairs: Annotation<ConnectionPair[]>({
   reducer: (state, update) => [...state, ...update],
   default: () => [],
 }),
 proposalSections: Annotation<Record<string, SectionContent>>({
   reducer: (state, update) => ({...state, ...update}),
   default: () => ({}),
 }),
 sectionDependencies: Annotation<Record<string, string[]>>,
 evaluationHistory: Annotation<EvaluationResult[]>({
   reducer: (state, update) => [...state, ...update],
   default: () => [],
 }),
 uiState: Annotation<UIState>
});
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each reducer to verify state transitions
2. Test immutability of all reducers to ensure no state mutation
3. Test serialization/deserialization of all state components
4. Verify default values are correctly applied for all annotations
5. Test complex nested state updates with multiple reducers
6. Verify proper handling of nested objects in reducers
7. Test error handling for reducers with invalid inputs
