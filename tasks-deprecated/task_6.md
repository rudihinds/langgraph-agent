# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Solution Sought Agent Subgraph
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build agent for determining specific solution requirements

# Details:
Implement the Solution Sought Agent subgraph to determine specific solution requirements based on RFP analysis and research findings. This agent will identify preferred approaches, unwanted methodologies, and generate a structured solution framework that aligns with funder preferences.

Key components to implement:

1. **Solution Sought Agent Structure**:
   - Create the solution agent state annotation extending the proposal state
   - Implement the main solution subgraph with appropriate nodes
   - Define clear interfaces for orchestrator integration
   - Create entry and exit points with proper state transformations

2. **Solution Requirements Analysis**:
   - Implement deep analysis of RFP requirements
   - Create pattern recognition for implicit preferences
   - Add detection of explicit constraints and limitations
   - Implement priority ranking for requirements

3. **Preferred Approach Identification**:
   - Create detection mechanism for desired methodologies
   - Implement historical pattern analysis from research
   - Add reasoning about funder values and priorities
   - Create structured representation of preferred approaches

4. **Unwanted Methodology Detection**:
   - Implement explicit exclusion criteria detection
   - Create implicit preference analysis
   - Add risk detection for controversial approaches
   - Implement warning system for potential issues

5. **Solution Framework Generation**:
   - Create structured solution framework production
   - Implement alignment checking with funder priorities
   - Add evidence linking for solution components
   - Create consistency checking across framework

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**:
   - Implement feedback collection for solution framework
   - Add rejection handling with explanation generation
   - Create modification support with consistency checking
   - Implement version tracking for solution iterations

The workflow should generally follow:
1. Analyze requirements from the RFP document
2. Incorporate relevant research findings about the funder
3. Identify explicit and implicit preferences
4. Detect unwanted or risky approaches
5. Generate a structured solution framework
6. Present for human feedback and incorporate revisions
7. Finalize and store in the proposal state

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for requirement analysis with sample RFPs
2. Test preferred approach detection with different funder profiles
3. Verify unwanted methodology detection with explicit and implicit cases
4. Test solution framework generation with diverse inputs
5. Verify human feedback incorporation with different feedback types
6. Test consistency checking with contradictory inputs
7. Create integration tests with the research agent
8. Verify proper state transformations throughout the solution analysis flow
