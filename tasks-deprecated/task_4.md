# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Orchestrator Agent Node
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the central coordination node for the agent system

# Details:
Implement the orchestrator node that serves as the central controller for the entire agent system. This node will manage workflow, coordinate between subgraphs, and handle user interactions.

Key components to implement:

1. **Orchestrator Node Structure**:
   - Create the main orchestrator node function
   - Implement state routing logic to appropriate subgraphs
   - Add entry points for user interactions
   - Define state transformations for subgraph inputs/outputs

2. **Workflow Management**:
   - Implement state machine logic for tracking progress
   - Create decision points for routing to appropriate subgraphs
   - Add parallel processing capabilities where dependencies allow
   - Implement sequence tracking for multi-stage operations

3. **User Interaction Handling**:
   - Add handlers for user input processing
   - Implement interrupt and resumption logic
   - Create feedback incorporation mechanisms
   - Add structured output formatting for UI consumption

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry policies for LLM and API operations
   - Add appropriate error classification
   - Create fallback mechanisms for failures
   - Implement graceful degradation paths

5. **Subgraph Coordination**:
   - Create interfaces for all subgraphs
   - Implement proper state transformations between graphs
   - Add dependency checking between subgraph operations
   - Create progress tracking for multi-step operations

6. **State Management**:
   - Implement efficient state updates with appropriate reducers
   - Create checkpointing triggers at key decision points
   - Add state verification before subgraph routing
   - Implement namespaced state for different operation phases

Core implementation pattern:
```typescript
export const orchestratorNode = async (
  state: ProposalState
): Promise<ProposalState> => {
  // Determine current phase and route accordingly
  const currentPhase = determineCurrentPhase(state);
  
  switch (currentPhase) {
    case Phase.RESEARCH:
      return await routeToResearchSubgraph(state);
    case Phase.SOLUTION_ANALYSIS:
      return await routeToSolutionSoughtSubgraph(state);
    case Phase.CONNECTION_PAIRS:
      return await routeToConnectionPairsSubgraph(state);
    case Phase.PROPOSAL_GENERATION:
      return await routeToProposalManagerSubgraph(state);
    case Phase.EVALUATION:
      return await routeToEvaluationSubgraph(state);
    case Phase.HUMAN_FEEDBACK:
      return await handleHumanFeedback(state);
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown phase: ${currentPhase}`);
  }
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for phase determination logic
2. Test routing to various subgraphs with different state conditions
3. Verify proper handling of user input and feedback
4. Test error handling with simulated failures in subgraphs
5. Benchmark performance with complex state objects
6. Test interrupt and resumption functionality
7. Create integration tests with mock subgraphs
8. Verify checkpoint creation at appropriate points
