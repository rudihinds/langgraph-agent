# Task ID: 11
# Title: Integrate Human-in-the-Loop Feedback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement interrupt handling for human feedback collection
# Details:
Utilize LangGraph's interrupt() function for pausing execution at key decision points. Implement Command primitive for resumption after feedback. Create warning system for dependency impacts when revising sections. Develop clear user interface points for feedback collection. Utilize LangGraph features for context window management when presenting proposal state. Implement streaming patterns for real-time feedback integration. Add fallback strategies for handling interruption failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test interrupt and resumption flow with sample feedback. Verify proper state preservation during interrupts. Test dependency warning system with section revisions. Validate context window management during feedback presentation. Test streaming of feedback integration. Verify fallback strategies during interruption failures.
