# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Human-in-the-Loop Interaction Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a robust system for human-agent collaboration

# Details:
Develop a comprehensive framework for human-in-the-loop interactions within the agent system that enables effective collaboration between automated agents and human users. This system should support approval workflows, feedback incorporation, and dynamic task allocation while maintaining a seamless user experience.

## Key Components:

1. **Interaction Protocols**:
   - Design standardized interaction patterns
   - Implement approval request workflows
   - Create feedback collection mechanisms
   - Add explanation generation for agent actions
   - Implement suggestion handling
   - Create configurable interaction styles

2. **UI Components**:
   - Create approval request cards
   - Implement feedback collection forms
   - Add real-time collaboration interfaces
   - Create historical action review UI
   - Implement explanation viewers
   - Add suggestion input mechanisms

3. **State Management**:
   - Implement wait states for human input
   - Create timeout handling
   - Add input validation
   - Implement feedback incorporation
   - Create state branching for alternatives
   - Add state rollback capabilities

4. **Agent Adaptation**:
   - Implement learning from human feedback
   - Create preference models
   - Add adaptive explanation generation
   - Implement style matching
   - Create workload balancing
   - Add confidence-based escalation

5. **Notification System**:
   - Implement email notifications
   - Create in-app alerts
   - Add SMS capabilities
   - Implement webhook integration
   - Create priority-based notification rules
   - Add notification preferences

6. **Collaboration Tools**:
   - Implement shared context viewing
   - Create collaborative editing
   - Add commenting capabilities
   - Implement version comparison
   - Create decision logs
   - Add knowledge sharing mechanisms

7. **Analytics & Improvement**:
   - Implement interaction metrics
   - Create feedback analysis
   - Add performance tracking
   - Implement improvement suggestions
   - Create user satisfaction measurement
   - Add A/B testing framework

## Implementation Guidelines:

- The interaction framework should be customizable for different user roles
- UI components should be responsive and accessible
- State management should handle asynchronous human input gracefully
- The system should provide clear feedback on agent actions and decisions
- Notification mechanisms should be configurable and respectful of user preferences
- Collaboration tools should support both synchronous and asynchronous work
- Analytics should drive continuous improvement of the interaction experience
- The framework should scale from simple approval flows to complex collaborations

## Expected Outcomes:

- Seamless collaboration between automated agents and human users
- Improved quality of agent outputs through human feedback
- Reduced friction in approval workflows
- Enhanced trust through transparent explanation mechanisms
- Effective knowledge transfer between humans and agents
- Balanced workload distribution based on capabilities
- Continuous improvement through interaction analytics
- Flexible adaptation to different collaboration scenarios

# Test Strategy:
1. Test basic approval workflows with various user roles
2. Verify handling of delayed human responses
3. Test feedback incorporation in agent behavior
4. Verify explanation generation for complex decisions
5. Test notification delivery across channels
6. Create user experience studies for collaboration tools
7. Test analytics collection and reporting
8. Verify accessibility of UI components
9. Test with simulated high-volume interaction scenarios
10. Create integration tests with full agent workflows
