# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Team Collaboration Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create features for team members to collaborate on proposal development

# Details:
Develop a collaborative workspace within the proposal generation system that allows multiple team members to work together efficiently on proposal development. This feature set will enable real-time collaboration, assignment tracking, version control, and communication tools integrated directly into the proposal workflow.

## Key Components:

1. **User Management and Permissions**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Create team and organization structures
   - Add user invitation and onboarding flow
   - Implement permission management for proposal sections
   - Create audit logging for user actions
   - Add user profiles with expertise tagging

2. **Real-Time Collaboration**:
   - Implement concurrent editing of proposal sections
   - Create real-time presence indicators
   - Add comment and annotation system
   - Implement change tracking and highlights
   - Create conflict resolution mechanisms
   - Add collaborative editing sessions

3. **Task Management**:
   - Create section assignment system
   - Implement task dependencies and workflows
   - Add deadline tracking and reminders
   - Create progress visualization
   - Implement workload balancing tools
   - Add priority management for tasks

4. **Review and Approval Workflows**:
   - Implement staged review processes
   - Create approval chains and dependencies
   - Add review comment resolution tracking
   - Implement comparative document views
   - Create approval status visualization
   - Add notification system for reviews

5. **Version Control and History**:
   - Implement document versioning
   - Create change history visualization
   - Add branching and merging capabilities
   - Implement rollback functionality
   - Create diff visualization between versions
   - Add metadata for version changes

6. **Communication Tools**:
   - Implement contextual messaging
   - Create team announcements and updates
   - Add @mention functionality
   - Implement discussion threads per section
   - Create decision tracking and rationales
   - Add integration with external communication tools

7. **Analytics and Reporting**:
   - Implement contribution tracking
   - Create team performance metrics
   - Add bottleneck identification
   - Implement timeline adherence reporting
   - Create quality metrics for contributions
   - Add collaboration pattern analysis

## Implementation Guidelines:

- All collaboration features should work in near real-time
- Security and data isolation must be maintained throughout
- The UI should provide clear indicators of collaborative activity
- Performance should be maintained even with multiple concurrent users
- Offline capabilities should be considered for interrupted connections
- The system should provide transparency into all collaborative actions
- Integration with existing workflows should be seamless
- Mobile accessibility should be considered for key collaboration features
- Notification preferences should be customizable per user
- All collaborative actions should be auditable and recoverable

## Expected Outcomes:

- Reduced coordination overhead in proposal development
- Improved proposal quality through systematic review processes
- Enhanced transparency into team member contributions
- More efficient resource allocation across proposal sections
- Better adherence to proposal timelines and deadlines
- Improved knowledge transfer between team members
- Reduced duplication of effort across proposal sections
- Enhanced accountability through clear task assignments
- Better preservation of historical decisions and rationales
- Improved team satisfaction through clear workflows

# Test Strategy:
1. Test concurrent editing with multiple simultaneous users
2. Verify permission enforcement across various user roles
3. Test notification delivery and relevance
4. Verify task assignment and completion workflows
5. Test version control with complex change patterns
6. Create stress tests for performance with large teams
7. Test offline functionality and synchronization
8. Verify audit logging for compliance requirements
9. Test mobile experience for critical collaboration features
10. Create integration tests with the proposal generation process
