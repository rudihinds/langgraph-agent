# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Section Generator Subgraphs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create specialized agents for each proposal section
# Details:
Implement section generator subgraphs for all required sections (Problem Statement, Solution, Organizational Capacity, etc.). Create specialized logic for each section type. Ensure proper state isolation and clear interfaces between subgraphs. Utilize LangGraph features for context window management when generating complex sections. Implement streaming patterns to return section content progressively. Add fallback strategies for API failures during section generation.

# Test Strategy:
Test generation of each section type with sample data. Verify proper formatting and content requirements for each section. Test section interfaces with parent graphs. Validate context window management with large section content. Test streaming of section generation. Verify fallback strategies during simulated API failures.
