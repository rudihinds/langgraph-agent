We do this by deploying a range of research and consultancy, data \nanalytics, innovative finance and service design tools, along with a systems thinking and social justice \nmindset. \nIn summary, our leadership structure is as follows:  \n• Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for overall strategic and financial direction, a post \ncurrently held on an interim basis by Caroline Gadd, and an Executive Team responsible for \nthe day-to-day operations of the organisation and strategic oversight of our business. \n \n• The Executive team includes Sara Jones, Executive Director of Innovation and People at SF. \n  \n• Leadership at Social Finance is currently undergoing a redesign. With a previous structure \nof Team Heads and then a wider Senior Leadership Group, (SLG) formed of Directors we will \nmove to an Executive team and the inclusion of a wider SLG with Associates Directors.  \n \n• Oversight and governance are provided by a Board of Directors which include the CEO, \nmembers of the Executive Team, and Non-Executive members with expertise from across \nSF’s business areas and sectors. \nUnderstanding, challenging and opposing racism is core to Social Finance’s aims and values. Working \ntowards race equity means continuously and intentionally challenging structural and individual racism, \nboth in the systems we work in and within our organisation. To achieve this, we commit to being: \n- Empathetic: Look from all viewpoints and centre voices from ethnic minority backgrounds. \nConsider the power imbalances in our partnerships and the intersection between racism and \nother inequities. \n- Curious: Ask questions about how and why racism persists across all the issues we work on \nand use rigorous thinking to scrutinise the power structures that enable it. \n- Pioneering: Work with diverse partners to use insight and practical innovation to challenge the \nstatus quo and ensure that systems meet everyone’s needs. \n\n Social Finance Limited \n +44 (0) 20 7770 6836 \n87 Vauxhall Walk, London SE11 \n5HJ \nsocialfinance.org.uk \n \n2 Social Finance is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA No. 497568 \n \n \nContext for current RFP \nSocial Finance have been successful in identifying actions that would bring about change in how we \nwork and the work we do. Many of these actions are listed in the appendix to this RFP. However, much \nof this progress to date has resulted in a detachment from our original racial equity aims. For example, \nour EDI surveys have reiterated the lack of diversity at a senior leadership level, particularly when \ncompared to our Analyst to Manager cohort. However, this continues to be an area in which we have \nfailed to make any meaningful progress. \nSenior leadership have recognised the need to step back to re-envisage and realign on the EDI aims \nbeing set out and to bring the various activities and workstreams together and provide clarity around \nownership and accountability. Following discussions with the SF Board and our Race Equity Advisory \nGroup (REAG) it has been agreed that external facilitation would be beneficial to support senior \nleadership development. We believe that facilitation can guide nuanced and honest conversations \naround power dynamics, language, intersectionality and what inclusive leadership at SF looks like to \nachieve the aims that were originally set out. \nWhilst our entry point for this work is our commitments around racial equity, we acknowledge the \nintersectional perspective needed to genuinely shift approaches, understanding and culture regarding \nEDI. Our hope is that this work will shine a light on other elements of our EDI considerations, such as \ngender, disability, faith and class. \n \nResponsibilities for the role holder \n• To hold facilitated reflection sessions with the Executive Team and senior leadership team \nindividually and as a group.  \n• To work with the CEO and EDI Leads to identify individual and structural blockers to progressing \nEDI work amongst senior leadership.  \n• Design and/or identify training needs that ensure longevity of impact. \n• To identify the resources and infrastructure (intrinsic or external to SF) that will enable us to \nachieve our EDI aims.  \n• To review SF’s strategy and develop the underpinning EDI principles and actions that support a \nrevised EDI strategy – which may or may not be a stand-alone strategy. \n• To identify gaps in our approach and the additional work that we need to do. \nThe outputs of this work should include: \n• Identification of gaps and barriers at senior leadership level \n• A strategy to overcome these barriers, including recommendations on the internal/external \nrequired support to achieve this \n• Clearly defined inclusive behaviours, particularly in terms of leadership \n• Consideration of how to capture what ‘success’ looks like – both in response to this facilitated \nintervention and recommendations on how to the measure the impact over a longer term, \nparticularly in terms of leadership behaviour level \n \nWhat we are not asking for \nThis work will not require the facilitator to undertake a listening exercise across the organisation. This \nwork has been conducted with members of the REAG and as part of an earlier Race Equity Audit. \nOutputs from this work will be shared with the facilitator as needed.  \n\n Social Finance Limited \n +44 (0) 20 7770 6836 \n87 Vauxhall Walk, London SE11 \n5HJ \nsocialfinance.org.uk \n \n3 Social Finance is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA No. 497568 \n \n \nWays of working \nYou will be working closely with the Race Equity Leads (Rachelle Angeline and Yasmin Begum). Weekly \nmeetings are suggested as a minimum rhythm of engagement. Fortnightly meetings will also be \nattended by the Interim CEO (Caroline Gadd) and EDI Lead (Sara Jones) as sponsors of this work. Other \nmembers of the Executive Team may join as needed. \nWhere possible, we would encourage working from the SF offices to increase opportunities to engage \nwith the race equity team and wider organisation. \n \nHow to respond \nThe budget envelope for this scope of work is £20,000 inclusive of VAT, with the work to be delivered \nover a 6-8 week period. The scope has been designed as a short piece of work, with the prospect of a \nlonger role as we execute the strategy dependent on budget, capacity, and need for ongoing support. \nIf you or your organisation meet the criteria above and would like to work with us in this next phase of \nwork, we would be very much interested in hearing from you. \nPlease provide up to 2 pages of A4 detailing: \n• Evidence of your experience and expertise in facilitating inquiry and exploration at leadership \nlevel \n• A brief summary of your understanding of this RFP \n• Your approach and workplan including recommendations on how it would be best delivered \no We would welcome particular reference to who from our new leadership structure \nshould be involved and why \no We would like to understand how you would approach integrating feedback from \ndifferent groups into the process and outputs \no We would appreciate an outline of how a focus on race equity, could also allow space \nfor improvements across a wider EDI agenda \n• Budget allocation and resourcing \n \n \nProcess  \nThe deadline for responses is Wednesday 5th February at 5pm.

We do this by deploying a range of research and consultancy, data \nanalytics, innovative finance and service design tools, along with a systems thinking and social justice \nmindset. \nIn summary, our leadership structure is as follows:  \n• Our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for overall strategic and financial direction, a post \ncurrently held on an interim basis by Caroline Gadd, and an Executive Team responsible for \nthe day-to-day operations of the organisation and strategic oversight of our business. \n \n• The Executive team includes Sara Jones, Executive Director of Innovation and People at SF. \n  \n• Leadership at Social Finance is currently undergoing a redesign. With a previous structure \nof Team Heads and then a wider Senior Leadership Group, (SLG) formed of Directors we will \nmove to an Executive team and the inclusion of a wider SLG with Associates Directors.  \n \n• Oversight and governance are provided by a Board of Directors which include the CEO, \nmembers of the Executive Team, and Non-Executive members with expertise from across \nSF’s business areas and sectors. \nUnderstanding, challenging and opposing racism is core to Social Finance’s aims and values. Working \ntowards race equity means continuously and intentionally challenging structural and individual racism, \nboth in the systems we work in and within our organisation. To achieve this, we commit to being: \n- Empathetic: Look from all viewpoints and centre voices from ethnic minority backgrounds. \nConsider the power imbalances in our partnerships and the intersection between racism and \nother inequities. \n- Curious: Ask questions about how and why racism persists across all the issues we work on \nand use rigorous thinking to scrutinise the power structures that enable it. \n- Pioneering: Work with diverse partners to use insight and practical innovation to challenge the \nstatus quo and ensure that systems meet everyone’s needs. \n\n Social Finance Limited \n +44 (0) 20 7770 6836 \n87 Vauxhall Walk, London SE11 \n5HJ \nsocialfinance.org.uk \n \n2 Social Finance is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA No. 497568 \n \n \nContext for current RFP \nSocial Finance have been successful in identifying actions that would bring about change in how we \nwork and the work we do. Many of these actions are listed in the appendix to this RFP. However, much \nof this progress to date has resulted in a detachment from our original racial equity aims. For example, \nour EDI surveys have reiterated the lack of diversity at a senior leadership level, particularly when \ncompared to our Analyst to Manager cohort. However, this continues to be an area in which we have \nfailed to make any meaningful progress. \nSenior leadership have recognised the need to step back to re-envisage and realign on the EDI aims \nbeing set out and to bring the various activities and workstreams together and provide clarity around \nownership and accountability. Following discussions with the SF Board and our Race Equity Advisory \nGroup (REAG) it has been agreed that external facilitation would be beneficial to support senior \nleadership development. We believe that facilitation can guide nuanced and honest conversations \naround power dynamics, language, intersectionality and what inclusive leadership at SF looks like to \nachieve the aims that were originally set out. \nWhilst our entry point for this work is our commitments around racial equity, we acknowledge the \nintersectional perspective needed to genuinely shift approaches, understanding and culture regarding \nEDI. Our hope is that this work will shine a light on other elements of our EDI considerations, such as \ngender, disability, faith and class. \n \nResponsibilities for the role holder \n• To hold facilitated reflection sessions with the Executive Team and senior leadership team \nindividually and as a group.  \n• To work with the CEO and EDI Leads to identify individual and structural blockers to progressing \nEDI work amongst senior leadership.  \n• Design and/or identify training needs that ensure longevity of impact. \n• To identify the resources and infrastructure (intrinsic or external to SF) that will enable us to \nachieve our EDI aims.  \n• To review SF’s strategy and develop the underpinning EDI principles and actions that support a \nrevised EDI strategy – which may or may not be a stand-alone strategy. \n• To identify gaps in our approach and the additional work that we need to do. \nThe outputs of this work should include: \n• Identification of gaps and barriers at senior leadership level \n• A strategy to overcome these barriers, including recommendations on the internal/external \nrequired support to achieve this \n• Clearly defined inclusive behaviours, particularly in terms of leadership \n• Consideration of how to capture what ‘success’ looks like – both in response to this facilitated \nintervention and recommendations on how to the measure the impact over a longer term, \nparticularly in terms of leadership behaviour level \n \nWhat we are not asking for \nThis work will not require the facilitator to undertake a listening exercise across the organisation.

Other \nmembers of the Executive Team may join as needed. \nWhere possible, we would encourage working from the SF offices to increase opportunities to engage \nwith the race equity team and wider organisation. \n \nHow to respond \nThe budget envelope for this scope of work is £20,000 inclusive of VAT, with the work to be delivered \nover a 6-8 week period. The scope has been designed as a short piece of work, with the prospect of a \nlonger role as we execute the strategy dependent on budget, capacity, and need for ongoing support. \nIf you or your organisation meet the criteria above and would like to work with us in this next phase of \nwork, we would be very much interested in hearing from you. \nPlease provide up to 2 pages of A4 detailing: \n• Evidence of your experience and expertise in facilitating inquiry and exploration at leadership \nlevel \n• A brief summary of your understanding of this RFP \n• Your approach and workplan including recommendations on how it would be best delivered \no We would welcome particular reference to who from our new leadership structure \nshould be involved and why \no We would like to understand how you would approach integrating feedback from \ndifferent groups into the process and outputs \no We would appreciate an outline of how a focus on race equity, could also allow space \nfor improvements across a wider EDI agenda \n• Budget allocation and resourcing \n \n \nProcess  \nThe deadline for responses is Wednesday 5th February at 5pm.
