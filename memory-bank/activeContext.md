# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus (as of 2024-07-26)

The primary focus is now squarely on **implementing the `documentLoaderNode`** (Task 16.1) according to the detailed plan derived from the TDD test suite. This involves:

- Writing the node function in `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/documentLoader.ts`.
- Integrating with the Supabase client for file download.
- Utilizing the `parseRfpFromBuffer` utility (or equivalent based on `UnstructuredLoader`).
- Handling various success and error scenarios (file types, Supabase errors, parsing errors).
- Correctly updating the `OverallProposalState` (`rfpDocument` status, content, metadata, errors).
- Ensuring proper temporary file handling and cleanup.

**Update (2024-07-26)**: The `documentLoaderNode` implementation has been written and all tests are now passing. Key learnings about Vitest mocking patterns have been documented to prevent similar issues in future tests.

Secondary focus remains on addressing the persistent issue preventing updates to `memory-bank/progress.md`.

## 2. Recent Changes (Last 24-48 hours)

- **`documentLoaderNode` Implementation Complete**: Successfully implemented the node that retrieves RFP documents from Supabase, parses them based on MIME type, and updates the proposal state.
- **Test Suite Fixed**: Resolved critical issues with Vitest mocking patterns for Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `os`).
- **Vitest Mocking Learnings**: Discovered and documented proper patterns for mocking modules with both default and named exports in Vitest.
- **Integration Test Plan**: Developed a detailed plan for integration testing the `documentLoaderNode`.
- **`progress.md` Update Failure:** Multiple attempts (including reapply) to update `progress.md` via file edits failed. The intended content was summarized in chat.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

1. **Implement Document Parser Node**: Begin work on the next node in the document processing pipeline (Task 16.2).
2. **Complete Integration Tests**: Implement the planned integration tests for `documentLoaderNode` to verify end-to-end functionality.
3. **Requirement Analysis Node**: Prepare for implementing the requirement analysis functionality.
4. **(If `progress.md` update fails again) Document Issue:** Log the persistent `progress.md` update failure as a known issue requiring investigation.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **TDD for Nodes:** Reinforce the decision to use TDD for subsequent node implementations.
- **Error Handling:** Prioritize robust error handling within node implementations.
- **State Management:** Ensure nodes correctly update `OverallProposalState`.
- **Vitest Mocking Patterns:** Apply consistent patterns for mocking Node.js built-in modules and ES modules:
  - Use `vi.hoisted()` to create mock functions that can be referenced in `vi.mock()` calls
  - Properly mock both default and named exports for ES modules
  - For Node.js built-in modules like `fs`, ensure proper mocking of nested properties (e.g., `fs.promises`)
  - Pay special attention to the structure of mocked modules to match import patterns
- **`progress.md` Issue:** Need to investigate _why_ the file edits are failing for this specific file. Permissions? Locking? Tooling bug?

## 5. Learnings & Project Insights

- **Core Functionality Gap:** Implementation of nodes/services is the critical path.
- **TDD Value:** Test suite provides a clear implementation roadmap.
- **Tool Reliability:** Encountered potential inconsistency with file editing tools for `progress.md`.
- **Vitest Mocking Challenges**: Several key insights about Vitest mocking:
  - ES Modules require special handling: When mocking modules with both default and named exports, you must provide both in the mock factory.
  - Hoisting matters: Use `vi.hoisted()` for creating mock functions that need to be referenced in `vi.mock()` calls.
  - Node.js built-ins structure: When mocking Node.js modules like `fs`, the structure must match the import pattern (e.g., `fs.promises.writeFile`).
  - Mock objects must match import structure: If code imports `x` from module and then uses `x.y.z()`, your mock must support that exact structure.
