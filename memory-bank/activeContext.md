# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus (as of 2024-07-26)

The primary focus is shifting to **Task 16.2: Implement Requirement Analysis (`solutionSoughtNode`)**. This involves:

- Reviewing the existing `solutionSoughtNode` implementation (located in `apps/backend/agents/research/nodes.ts`).
- Verifying its alignment with the newly created specification (`spec_16.2.md`).
- Developing and running comprehensive unit tests based on the specification.
- Ensuring correct integration within the `ProposalGenerationGraph` and proper state management (`OverallProposalState`).

**Secondary Focus:**

- Completing planned integration tests for `documentLoaderNode` (Task 16.1).
- Addressing the persistent issue preventing updates to `memory-bank/progress.md` if it recurs.

## 2. Recent Changes (Last 24-48 hours)

- **`solutionSoughtNode` Specification Created**: Defined a detailed high-level specification in `spec_16.2.md` outlining the expected behavior, inputs, outputs, error handling, and integration points for the requirement analysis node.
- **`deepResearchNode` Compatibility Confirmed**: Verified that the existing `deepResearchNode` implementation is compatible with the current architecture and state management patterns.
- **`documentLoaderNode` Implementation Complete**: Successfully implemented the node that retrieves RFP documents from Supabase, parses them based on MIME type, and updates the proposal state.
- **Test Suite Fixed**: Resolved critical issues with Vitest mocking patterns for Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `os`).
- **Vitest Mocking Learnings**: Discovered and documented proper patterns for mocking modules with both default and named exports in Vitest.
- **Integration Test Plan**: Developed a detailed plan for integration testing the `documentLoaderNode`.
- **`progress.md` Update Failure:** Multiple attempts (including reapply) to update `progress.md` via file edits failed. The intended content was summarized in chat.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate Priorities)

1.  **Review `solutionSoughtNode` Code**: Analyze the existing implementation against `spec_16.2.md`.
2.  **Write `solutionSoughtNode` Tests**: Develop unit tests covering success paths, error handling, and edge cases defined in the spec.
3.  **Implement/Refine `solutionSoughtNode`**: Make necessary adjustments to the code based on the review and test results.
4.  **Complete `documentLoaderNode` Integration Tests**: Implement the planned integration tests for Task 16.1.
5.  **(If `progress.md` update fails again) Document Issue:** Log the persistent `progress.md` update failure as a known issue requiring investigation.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **TDD for Nodes:** Reinforce the decision to use TDD for subsequent node implementations.
- **Error Handling:** Prioritize robust error handling within node implementations.
- **State Management:** Ensure nodes correctly update `OverallProposalState`.
- **Vitest Mocking Patterns:** Apply consistent patterns for mocking Node.js built-in modules and ES modules:
  - Use `vi.hoisted()` to create mock functions that can be referenced in `vi.mock()` calls
  - Properly mock both default and named exports for ES modules
  - For Node.js built-in modules like `fs`, ensure proper mocking of nested properties (e.g., `fs.promises`)
  - Pay special attention to the structure of mocked modules to match import patterns
- **`progress.md` Issue:** Need to investigate _why_ the file edits are failing for this specific file. Permissions? Locking? Tooling bug?

## 5. Learnings & Project Insights

- **Spec-Driven Testing:** Creating a clear spec (`spec_16.2.md`) provides a solid foundation for writing targeted and effective tests.
- **Architecture Pivot Verification:** Necessary to confirm compatibility of prior work (`deepResearchNode`) with new architectural patterns before proceeding.
- **Core Functionality Gap:** Implementation of nodes/services remains the critical path.
- **TDD Value:** Test suite provides a clear implementation roadmap.
- **Tool Reliability:** Encountered potential inconsistency with file editing tools for `progress.md`.
- **Vitest Mocking Challenges**: Several key insights about Vitest mocking:
  - ES Modules require special handling: When mocking modules with both default and named exports, you must provide both in the mock factory.
  - Hoisting matters: Use `vi.hoisted()` for creating mock functions that need to be referenced in `vi.mock()` calls.
  - Node.js built-ins structure: When mocking Node.js modules like `fs`, the structure must match the import pattern (e.g., `fs.promises.writeFile`).
  - Mock objects must match import structure: If code imports `x` from module and then uses `x.y.z()`, your mock must support that exact structure.
