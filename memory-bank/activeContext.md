# Active Context - Proposal Agent Development

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Focus: Document Parsing System Implementation Complete âœ…**

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive document parsing and storage system for RFP documents, establishing proper data relationships and parsing capabilities for multi-page documents.

**Latest Accomplishment: Proposal Documents Refactoring Complete âœ…**

### **âœ… Document Storage & Parsing System Implementation:**

**1. Database Structure Redesign:**

- Created `proposal_documents` table with proper relationships to `proposals`
- Migrated existing data from `metadata.rfp_document` to normalized structure
- Established foreign key relationships and referential integrity
- Added proper indexing and Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Successfully migrated all existing document metadata

**2. Service Layer Implementation:**

- Built comprehensive `ProposalDocumentService` (backend) for full document management
- Created client-side service for Next.js API routes integration
- Implemented document parsing, storage, and text extraction capabilities

- Automatic text storage in both `proposal_documents` and `proposals` tables
- Status tracking for parsing operations (`pending`, `success`, `failed`)
- On-demand parsing with caching for performance

**5. API Endpoints:**

- Upload endpoint with new service integration and proper auth
- Parse document endpoint for on-demand text extraction
- Proper authentication, authorization, and error handling
- Support for background parsing workflows

### **âœ… Benefits Realized:**

**Data Integrity:**

- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- No more orphaned metadata or missing file references
- Proper storage object tracking with UUIDs
- Normalized data structure eliminates JSON metadata complexity

**Performance:**

- Cached parsed text in database (no re-parsing needed)
- Indexed queries for fast document lookup by proposal ID
- Efficient storage and retrieval patterns
- Multi-page document support with single text extraction

**Maintainability:**

- Clean separation of concerns between upload, storage, and parsing
- Centralized document management logic in service layer
- Proper error handling and comprehensive logging
- Type-safe interfaces throughout the system

**Scalability:**

- Support for multiple documents per proposal (architecture ready)
- Versioning capability built into table structure
- Background parsing support infrastructure in place
- Extensible to additional file formats

### **âœ… Technical Implementation Details:**

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE proposal_documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  proposal_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES proposals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_type TEXT,
  size_bytes INTEGER,
  storage_object_id UUID,
  parsed_text TEXT,
  parsed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  parsing_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (parsing_status IN ('pending', 'success', 'failed')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Service Architecture:**

- `ProposalDocumentService` handles all document operations
- Automatic `proposals.rfp_document_id` updates on document creation
- Cached text storage in both tables for performance
- Comprehensive error handling and status tracking

**Parsing Capabilities:**

- PDF: Full multi-page text extraction with metadata
- DOCX: Complete document parsing with mammoth library
- TXT: UTF-8 text file support
- Metadata preservation (page count, file info, etc.)
- Graceful error handling with fallback mechanisms

**Testing Results:**

- Successfully parsed real PDF document (56,743 characters)
- Verified database relationships and data integrity
- Confirmed multi-page document support
- Validated upload and parsing workflow end-to-end

3. **Document Versioning:** Track document updates and versions
4. **Advanced Parsing:** Extract structured data (sections, requirements, etc.)
5. **Search Integration:** Full-text search across parsed documents
6. **Document Analysis:** AI-powered content analysis and summarization

## Previous Accomplishments

**Backend Refactoring Complete âœ…**

We successfully completed ALL 5 PHASES of the comprehensive backend refactoring plan outlined in `backend-refactor.md`. The backend is now fully refactored with clean architecture, consolidated configuration, and standardized structure.

**Latest Previous Accomplishment: Backend File Structure Documentation Update âœ…**

- Updated `apps/backend/docs/backend-file-structure.md` to reflect the current state after all refactoring phases
- Documented all key changes from the 5-phase refactoring process
- Added comprehensive sections on refactoring accomplishments and impacts
- Updated best practices and guidelines to reflect modern architecture
- Included new testing structure and configuration centralization details

**Debugging Journey & Resolutions:**

1.  **Initial Error: Recursion in Frontend (`useToast`)**

    - Identified a `useEffect` in `apps/web/src/features/ui/components/toast.tsx` with a missing dependency array, causing excessive re-renders.
    - **Resolution:** Added an empty dependency array `[]` to the `useEffect` in `useToast`.

2.  **Next Error: 404 on Express Backend (`POST /api/rfp/proposal_threads`)**

    - The frontend was correctly trying to hit this endpoint (on port 3001) to record a new proposal thread association.
    - **Resolution Path:** Corrected route mounting in Express server and fixed path configurations.

3.  **Next Error: 404 on LangGraph Server (`POST http://localhost:2024/threads/.../history`)**
    - **Root Cause:** The checkpointer (specifically `PostgresSaver`) was not creating the necessary database tables.
    - **Resolution:** Ensured `await checkpointer.setup()` is called correctly during server initialization.

**Current State & Learnings:**

- The distinct roles of `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for the Express backend on port 3001) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_API_URL` (for the LangGraph server on port 2024) are critical and now correctly configured.
- The `PostgresSaver.setup()` method is crucial for LangGraph.js when using PostgreSQL persistence.
- Document parsing system now provides robust foundation for RFP text analysis.

## Active Issues & Blockers

- None currently. Document parsing system is fully operational and tested.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Document Management:** Use `ProposalDocumentService` for all document operations
- **Data Integrity:** Maintain foreign key relationships between proposals and documents
- **Parsing Strategy:** Cache parsed text in database, parse on-demand for new documents
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging and graceful degradation for parsing failures
- **Multi-page Support:** Extract all content into single text stream for analysis
- **Storage Patterns:** Use Supabase storage with proper object tracking and metadata

## Current Work Focus

**Ready for Next Phase:** Document parsing system is complete and operational. Ready to begin work on initial document parsing flow integration with the proposal generation agent.
