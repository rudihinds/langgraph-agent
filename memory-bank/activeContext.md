# Active Development Context

_Last updated: August 22, 2023_

## Current Focus

We are currently implementing Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) functionality for the proposal generation system, following the architecture specified in AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md and AGENT_BASESPEC.md.

### Recently Completed

- Implemented all evaluation nodes with HITL interrupt capabilities:
  - `evaluateResearchNode`
  - `evaluateSolutionNode`
  - `evaluateSectionNode`
  - `evaluateConnectionsNode`
- Configured the graph's `interruptAfter` list to include all evaluation nodes
- Implemented `OrchestratorService` with methods to detect interrupts, retrieve interrupt details, and extract content for UI presentation
- Added comprehensive tests for all interrupt detection and handling functionality

### Current Task

**Task 14.3.2: Implement user feedback submission and processing in OrchestratorService**

We are now working on extending the `OrchestratorService` to handle user feedback when an interrupt occurs. This involves:

1. Adding methods to receive and process user feedback (approve/revise/regenerate)
2. Updating the proposal state with feedback information
3. Preparing the state for graph resumption

This task forms a critical part of the HITL workflow, allowing users to provide feedback on generated content before the graph proceeds.

### Next Steps

- Complete feedback submission implementation (Task 3.2)
- Implement graph resumption after feedback (Task 3.3)
- Implement feedback processing nodes (Task 4.x)
- Create API endpoints for frontend integration (Task 6.x)

### Current Technical Focus

The HITL implementation is foundationally solid with working state structure and conditional logic. Focus now is on configuring graph interrupt points and implementing the OrchestratorService integration to manage the actual interruption lifecycle.

## Key Decisions & Patterns

- Using the `interruptStatus` field in state to track whether a graph is currently paused for human input
- Implementing specialized reducers for complex state updates (like `interruptStatusReducer`)
- Using conditional logic to route based on user feedback type

## Open Questions & Challenges

- How to best structure the interruption resumption flow in terms of OrchestratorService APIs
- How to handle timeouts for long-running interrupts
- How to properly test the full interrupt cycle from interruption to feedback to resumption

## Recent Learnings

1. The Zod validation schema implementation for `interruptStatus` is working well, with all tests passing
2. The conditional routing for stale content is functioning correctly, which is a critical part of the system
3. The `routeAfterStaleContentChoice` function properly handles different types of user feedback

## Recent Changes

1. **HITL Implementation Plan**: Created a detailed implementation plan for task 14.3 with hierarchical task breakdown including checkboxes for tracking progress. The plan includes clear specifications for:

   - State structure updates
   - Graph configuration
   - Orchestrator service integration
   - API endpoints
   - Testing strategy

2. **Routing Conditionals Implementation**: Implemented routing conditionals for the proposal generation graph with comprehensive test coverage.

3. **StateGraph Design**: Established the StateGraph design with proper node connections and edge definitions.

4. **Conditionals Test Suite**: Developed a complete test suite for conditionals with 100% test coverage.

5. **Dependency Completion**: Confirmed completion of all prerequisites for HITL implementation:
   - Task 13: Checkpointer Implementation ✅
   - Task 14.1: ProposalGenerationGraph with evaluation nodes ✅
   - Task 14.2: OrchestratorService framework ✅

## Implementation Plans

### HITL Capabilities (Task 14.3)

The implementation plan for HITL capabilities has been fully developed and includes a clear task breakdown with priorities and estimated timelines. The plan follows a hierarchical structure for easy tracking and implementation:

1. **State Structure** (Days 1-2, High Priority)

   - Add interrupt tracking to `OverallProposalState`
   - Implement interfaces for interrupts and feedback
   - Update state documentation

2. **Graph Configuration** (Days 2-3, High Priority)

   - Add interrupt points after evaluation nodes
   - Configure `interruptAfter` list
   - Add edge definitions for interrupt handling

3. **State Annotations** (Day 4, High Priority)

   - Add annotations for interrupt fields
   - Implement state reducers
   - Add tests for state updates

4. **OrchestratorService Integration** (Days 5-7, High Priority)

   - Implement `detectInterrupt` method
   - Add `submitFeedback` method
   - Create `resumeFromInterrupt` method
   - Add comprehensive tests

5. **Feedback Processing** (Days 8-9, High/Medium Priority)

   - Implement `processFeedbackNode`
   - Create revision handling
   - Implement regeneration logic
   - Add tests for all feedback types

6. **Conditional Logic** (Days 10-11, High/Medium Priority)

   - Add routing functions for feedback types
   - Test conditional routing

7. **API Layer** (Days 12-13, High Priority)

   - Add interrupt status endpoint
   - Implement feedback submission
   - Create resume endpoint
   - Add validation middleware

8. **Timeout Handling** (Day 14, Medium Priority)

   - Configure timeouts
   - Implement detection logic
   - Add recovery mechanisms

9. **Integration Testing** (Days 15-16, High/Medium Priority)

   - Test full interrupt cycle
   - Test all feedback types
   - Verify state persistence

10. **Error Handling** (Day 17, High/Medium Priority)
    - Test timeout scenarios
    - Test invalid feedback
    - Test interrupted state recovery

This implementation approach has been validated against the requirements in `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and follows the established patterns in `AGENT_BASESPEC.md`. The approach focuses on maintaining a clear separation of concerns, robust error handling, and comprehensive testing at each stage.

## Important Design Patterns

1. **Hybrid Orchestration Pattern**: The system uses a combination of a central Orchestrator service for coordination and a LangGraph for the proposal generation workflow.

2. **State-Driven Routing**: Conditional routing within the graph is based on the current state of the proposal, allowing for dynamic workflow adjustments.

3. **Checkpointing Strategy**: The system uses a persistent checkpointing strategy to save state at critical points, enabling resumption after interruptions.

4. **HITL Integration**: Human-in-the-loop capabilities are integrated at strategic points in the workflow, particularly after evaluation nodes, to allow for user feedback and course correction.

5. **Component Separation**: Clear separation between the Orchestrator, ProposalGenerationGraph, and EditorAgent components, with well-defined interfaces.

## Learnings and Insights

1. **State Design**: The state structure needs to be carefully designed to support both the graph's internal logic and external interactions with the Orchestrator and API.

2. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, end-to-end) is essential for ensuring the reliability of the complex workflow.

3. **Modular Architecture**: The separation of concerns between the Orchestrator, Graph, and EditorAgent components has proven beneficial for maintainability and testability.

4. **Dependency Management**: Clear documentation of dependencies between tasks has helped in planning and executing the implementation in a logical sequence.

5. **Interrupt Handling**: The design of interrupt points and state management for interrupts requires careful consideration to ensure seamless user experience.

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing HITL capabilities according to the detailed task breakdown in the implementation plan, starting with state structure updates and graph configuration for interrupt points.

2. Complete the integration of the EditorAgent service with the Orchestrator and ProposalGenerationGraph.

3. Develop the API endpoints for the HITL workflow, including status retrieval, feedback submission, and resumption.

4. Add robust error handling throughout the system, particularly for interrupted workflows and timeout scenarios.

5. Implement comprehensive testing for all components of the HITL workflow, including both happy path and edge cases.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Used for the checkpointer to separate storage concerns from LangGraph interface requirements.
2. **Factory Pattern**: Used to create the appropriate checkpointer instance based on environment configuration.
3. **Test-First Development**: Create tests before or alongside implementation to ensure robustness.
4. **Clear Interface Contracts**: Define explicit interfaces before implementation to ensure consistency.
5. **Centralized Environment Management**: Use a single source of truth for environment variables in the root `.env` file.

## Current Learnings & Insights

1. **LangGraph Interface Limitations**: The `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface is somewhat limited and requires adapter classes to bridge with our more flexible implementation.
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: The ability to fall back to in-memory storage has proven valuable for development and testing, and for handling configuration errors.
3. **TypeScript Exports/Imports**: Careful management of TypeScript imports/exports is essential to prevent circular dependencies and ensure clean code organization.
4. **Environment Configuration**: A single source of truth for environment variables simplifies configuration and reduces potential for conflicts.

## Open Questions & Decisions

1. **Database Migrations**: Should we implement proper migration support for the database schema to allow for future changes?
2. **Stale Checkpoint Handling**: How should we handle checkpoints that become stale due to interruptions or errors?
3. **State Object Serialization**: The current approach serializes the entire state object. Should we consider more selective serialization for performance?
4. **Error Management During Checkpointer Operations**: How should graph execution respond to errors during checkpointer operations?
5. **Retry Mechanisms**: Should we implement automatic retry mechanisms for transient database errors?
