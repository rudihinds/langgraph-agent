# Active Development Context

_Last updated: August 21, 2023_

## Current Focus

The development is currently focused on implementing a robust persistence layer using the adapter pattern. This ensures:

1. **Storage Flexibility**: We can switch between storage solutions (in-memory, Supabase, potentially others) without changing application code.
2. **Interface Consistency**: All storage implementations expose the same interface aligned with LangGraph's `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
3. **Multi-tenant Security**: Proper isolation of data by userId to ensure security in a multi-tenant environment.
4. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to in-memory storage when database credentials are missing or invalid.
5. **Environment Simplification**: Centralized environment variable management in the root `.env` file.

## Recent Changes

1. **Completed the `ICheckpointer` interface** that defines the contract for all storage implementations.
2. **Implemented `InMemoryCheckpointer`** for development and testing scenarios.
3. **Implemented `SupabaseCheckpointer`** for production use with proper error handling.
4. **Created adapter classes** to bridge our storage implementations with LangGraph's requirements.
5. **Implemented a factory function** that selects the appropriate checkpointer based on environment configuration.
6. **Developed comprehensive error handling** throughout the persistence layer.
7. **Standardized environment configuration** by centralizing all variables in the root `.env` file.
8. **Created a robust test script** to verify all checkpointer operations.
9. **Ensured multi-tenant isolation** by including userId in thread ID generation.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the LangGraph implementation**:

   - Update the proposal agent graph to align with the latest state definitions
   - Implement the required node functions for each stage of proposal generation
   - Create conditional routing functions for decision points and error handling

2. **Develop comprehensive testing**:

   - Unit tests for individual node functions
   - Integration tests for graph execution
   - End-to-end tests for full proposal generation

3. **Create the API layer**:
   - Develop endpoints for initiating and controlling proposal generation
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Expose appropriate state information for the frontend

## Important Patterns & Preferences

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Used for the checkpointer to separate storage concerns from LangGraph interface requirements.
2. **Factory Pattern**: Used to create the appropriate checkpointer instance based on environment configuration.
3. **Test-First Development**: Create tests before or alongside implementation to ensure robustness.
4. **Clear Interface Contracts**: Define explicit interfaces before implementation to ensure consistency.
5. **Centralized Environment Management**: Use a single source of truth for environment variables in the root `.env` file.

## Current Learnings & Insights

1. **LangGraph Interface Limitations**: The `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface is somewhat limited and requires adapter classes to bridge with our more flexible implementation.
2. **Graceful Fallbacks**: The ability to fall back to in-memory storage has proven valuable for development and testing, and for handling configuration errors.
3. **TypeScript Exports/Imports**: Careful management of TypeScript imports/exports is essential to prevent circular dependencies and ensure clean code organization.
4. **Environment Configuration**: A single source of truth for environment variables simplifies configuration and reduces potential for conflicts.

## Open Questions & Decisions

1. **Database Migrations**: Should we implement proper migration support for the database schema to allow for future changes?
2. **Stale Checkpoint Handling**: How should we handle checkpoints that become stale due to interruptions or errors?
3. **State Object Serialization**: The current approach serializes the entire state object. Should we consider more selective serialization for performance?
4. **Error Management During Checkpointer Operations**: How should graph execution respond to errors during checkpointer operations?
5. **Retry Mechanisms**: Should we implement automatic retry mechanisms for transient database errors?
