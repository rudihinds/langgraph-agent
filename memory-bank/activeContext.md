# Active Development Context

_Last updated: July 30, 2023_

## Current Focus

We are implementing a robust persistence layer for the LangGraph-based proposal agent using the adapter pattern. This provides:

1. **Storage flexibility** - Supporting both in-memory storage for development/testing and Supabase database storage for production.
2. **Interface consistency** - Maintaining a clean interface that adapts to LangGraph's `BaseCheckpointSaver` requirements.
3. **Multi-tenant security** - Including userId in storage operations to ensure proper data isolation.
4. **Graceful fallbacks** - Defaulting to in-memory storage when database credentials are unavailable.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the `ICheckpointer` interface defining our storage contract
- Created `InMemoryCheckpointer` for local development and testing
- Implemented `SupabaseCheckpointer` for production database storage
- Built adapter classes that bridge our storage implementations with LangGraph's requirements
- Developed a factory function that selects the appropriate checkpointer implementation
- Created a test script to verify all checkpointer operations
- Configured environment variables to load from the root `.env` file
- Removed redundant `.env` file from the backend directory

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the LangGraph implementation**:

   - Finish the proposal agent graph structure
   - Implement node functions for research generation, section planning, content generation, etc.
   - Create the conditional routing logic for HITL decision points

2. **Develop comprehensive testing**:

   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for graph execution
   - End-to-end tests for full proposal generation

3. **Create the API layer**:
   - Design RESTful endpoints for frontend interaction
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add proper error handling and validation

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Adapter Pattern**: We're using the adapter pattern for storage implementations to decouple our internal storage logic from LangGraph's interface requirements.
- **Factory Pattern**: The checkpointer factory provides the appropriate implementation based on available configuration.
- **Test-First Development**: We're writing tests before or alongside implementation to ensure robustness.
- **Clear Interface Contracts**: We define explicit interfaces for all components to ensure proper implementation.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Services provide fallbacks when ideal resources (like database credentials) are unavailable.
- **Clear Error Messages**: We provide detailed error messages to aid debugging.

## Current Learnings & Insights

- LangGraph's `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface is focused on individual checkpoints without built-in support for multi-tenant isolation, so we need to handle this ourselves.
- Providing graceful fallbacks to in-memory storage simplifies development and testing.
- Environment variable management is simpler when consolidated in a single root `.env` file rather than having multiple files across the project.
- Thread ID generation needs to include userId to ensure proper multi-tenant isolation.
- The TypeScript module system requires careful management of imports and exports, especially when using ECMAScript modules.
- Supabase integration requires both client-side and server-side authentication handling.

## Open Questions & Decisions

- Should we add database migrations for the checkpoints table creation, or rely on the setup script?
- How should we handle stale checkpoints? Should we add a TTL or cleanup mechanism?
- What's the most efficient way to serialize the state object for storage?
- How should we handle errors during checkpointer operations in the graph execution flow?
