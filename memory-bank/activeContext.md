## Current Focus: LangGraph Agent Refactoring & Persistence Layer Enhancements

We are actively working on refactoring the LangGraph agent backend according to the specifications outlined in `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENT_BASESPEC.md`, with a current focus on the persistence layer and TypeScript compatibility.

## Recent Changes & Completed Tasks

- **Task #11 (State Management Alignment): Completed**

  - Aligned `ProposalState` interface in `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts` with architectural specs.
  - Implemented necessary type definitions (`LoadingStatus`, `ProcessingStatus`, etc.).
  - Defined `ProposalStateAnnotation` using `Annotation.Root` and custom reducers.
  - Added `lastValueReducer`, `createdAtReducer`, `lastUpdatedAtReducer` helper functions.
  - Implemented and enhanced Zod schema (`ProposalStateSchema`) for runtime validation, particularly for the `sections` map.
  - Committed changes: `feat(state): align ProposalState with spec, add reducers & Zod schema (Task #11)`

- **Task #13 (Persistence Layer Refinement): In Progress**
  - Implemented `ICheckpointer` interface
  - Implemented `SupabaseCheckpointer` class
  - Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues:
    - Changed static method calls in tests to instance method calls
    - Replaced spread operator with `Array.from()` for Set iteration to ensure compatibility with lower ECMAScript targets
  - Added comprehensive unit tests
  - Corrected error handling and retry mechanisms

## Immediate Next Steps

- **Merge Current Changes & Branch**

  - Commit and push recent fixes to `feature/update-error-tests`
  - Merge to `main` to establish a stable baseline
  - Create a new branch for the upcoming major code cleanup effort

- **Task #14 (Graph Structure Refinement)**
  - Update `ProposalGenerationGraph` definition
  - Implement proper routing functions
  - Configure HITL interrupt points
  - Implement conditional edges based on evaluation results

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **TypeScript Compatibility:** We've addressed issues with Set iteration that were causing TypeScript errors when targeting lower ECMAScript versions. Using `Array.from()` instead of the spread operator (`[...set]`) ensures maximum compatibility.

- **Test-First Approach:** We're addressing test files first to ensure our implementation meets the specified interfaces, then fixing implementation files to match. This approach helps catch interface issues early.

- **Code Cleanup Planning:** The upcoming cleanup will be extensive, requiring a stable base branch to revert to if needed. This is why we're focusing on merging the current changes to main before branching off.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Adhere strictly to `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENT_BASESPEC.md`.
- Follow `REFACTOR.md` task order and dependencies.
- Prioritize type safety (using Zod validation where explicit typing fails).
- Maintain clear commit messages linked to tasks.
- Keep files under 300 lines.
- Ensure backward compatibility with various TypeScript/ECMAScript targets.
