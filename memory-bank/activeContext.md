## Graph Updates

The proposal generation graph now accepts an `rfpId` parameter during initialization:

```typescript
export const createProposalGenerationGraph = async (
  rfpId?: string,
  userId?: string
) => {
  // Create a new StateGraph with OverallProposalState
  const graph = new StateGraph<ProposalStateAnnotation>({
    channels: {
      messages: messagesStateReducer,
    },
  });

  // Register nodes...

  // Initialize state with rfpId if provided
  const initialState: Partial<OverallProposalState> = {
    rfpId: rfpId || process.env.DEFAULT_RFP_ID || "default",
    userId: userId || "test-user",
    status: "not_started",
    sections: new Map(),
    errors: [],
  };

  // Add the checkpointer
  const checkpointer = createCheckpointer();

  // Compile the graph
  return {
    graph: graph.compile(),
    checkpointer,
    initialState,
  };
};
```

## Orchestrator Service Updates

The Orchestrator Service has been enhanced to handle rfpId:

```typescript
export class OrchestratorService {
  // ...

  async startProposalGeneration({
    rfpId,
    userId,
  }: StartProposalOptions): Promise<string> {
    try {
      // Initialize graph with rfpId and userId
      const { graph, checkpointer, initialState } =
        await createProposalGenerationGraph(rfpId, userId);

      // Generate a unique thread ID for this proposal
      const threadId = uuidv4();

      // Start the graph with initial state
      const runner = await graph.start({
        checkpointer,
        threadId,
        state: initialState,
      });

      // Return the thread ID for future reference
      return threadId;
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error(`Failed to start proposal generation: ${error.message}`);
      throw new Error(
        `Orchestrator failed to start proposal generation: ${error.message}`
      );
    }
  }

  // ...
}
```

## API Updates

Express handlers have been updated to accept rfpId:

```typitten
// Start a new proposal generation with rfpId
router.post("/api/rfp/start", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { rfpId, userId } = req.body;

    // Validate required parameters
    if (!rfpId) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: "Missing required rfpId parameter",
      });
    }

    // Call orchestrator with rfpId
    const threadId = await orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration({
      rfpId,
      userId,
    });

    return res.status(200).json({ threadId });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error("Error starting proposal generation:", error);
    return res.status(500).json({
      error: "Failed to start proposal generation",
      details: error.message,
    });
  }
});
```

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Authentication Token Refresh Strategy

We've implemented a proactive token refresh approach in the authentication middleware:

1. **Token Refresh Thresholds**:

   - A threshold constant `TOKEN_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_SECONDS = 600` (10 minutes) defines when tokens should be refreshed
   - Tokens with less than 10 minutes before expiration are flagged for refresh
   - This balances security with user experience by preventing unnecessary refreshes

2. **Expiration Metadata**:

   - `req.tokenExpiresIn`: Number of seconds until token expiration
   - `req.tokenRefreshRecommended`: Boolean flag indicating if token refresh is recommended
   - This metadata allows route handlers to make informed decisions about token refresh

3. **Expired Token Handling**:

   - Expired tokens return a 401 response with `refresh_required: true`
   - This special flag helps clients distinguish between expired tokens and other auth errors
   - Enables frontend to implement automatic token refresh and request retry

4. **Client Integration**:
   - Frontend can add token refresh logic for proactive and reactive refresh scenarios
   - Response headers (e.g., `X-Token-Refresh-Recommended`) can be used to signal refresh needs
   - This pattern avoids unnecessary interruptions to the user experience

### Modular Node Implementation

We've adopted a more modular approach to node implementation:

1. **Directory Structure**:

   - Each major node gets its own file in the `nodes/` directory
   - Tests for each node are in `nodes/__tests__/` directory
   - Common utilities and helpers remain in shared locations

2. **Export Pattern**:

   - Export node functions from their individual files
   - Re-export from the main nodes.js file for backward compatibility
   - Use named exports to maintain clear function naming

3. **Import Patterns**:
   - Use `@/` path aliases for imports from shared directories
   - Use relative imports for closely related files

### Section Management Strategy

The section management strategy has been implemented with the following approach:

1. **Section Types and Dependencies**:

   - Each section type is defined in the SectionType enum
   - Dependencies between sections are defined in the section manager
   - Topological sorting is used to determine generation order

2. **Section Status Management**:

   - Sections progress through states: QUEUED → RUNNING → READY_FOR_EVALUATION → AWAITING_REVIEW → APPROVED/EDITED/STALE
   - Only sections that are QUEUED or STALE are regenerated
   - Existing approved sections are preserved

3. **Section Data Structure**:
   - Each section has a standardized data structure
   - Includes content, status, title, and metadata
   - Timestamps for creation and updates
   - Error tracking for failed generations

### LLM Integration Patterns

For LLM-based section generation, we've established these patterns:

1. **Prompt Design**:

   - Clear, structured prompts with specific instructions
   - Context provided from RFP, research, and connections
   - Output format expectations clearly defined
   - Examples where needed for complex formats

2. **Output Parsing**:

   - Zod schemas for structured validation
   - Type-safe output extraction
   - Error handling for malformed outputs
   - Fallback strategies for parsing failures

3. **Context Window Management**:
   - Truncation of large inputs to fit context windows
   - Prioritization of most relevant content
   - Maintenance of key context even with truncation
   - Logging of truncation for debugging

### Error Handling Patterns

A consistent error handling pattern has emerged across node implementations:

1. Early validation of required inputs
2. Specific classification of different error types (missing input, LLM API errors, parsing errors)
3. Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
4. State updates to reflect error conditions
5. Preservation of raw responses for debugging

### State Management

The state management follows established patterns:

1. Status transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review/error)
2. Immutable state updates
3. Detailed message logging
4. Clear error propagation

### Naming Consistency

We maintain consistent naming conventions:

- Node functions: camelCase verb-noun format (e.g., `sectionManagerNode`, `problemStatementNode`)
- Status fields: snake_case (e.g., `connectionsStatus`)
- State fields: camelCase (e.g., `connections`, `solutionResults`)
- File names: snake_case (e.g., `section_manager.ts`, `problem_statement.ts`)

## Implementation Insights

1. **Modular Architecture Benefits**: Moving to a more modular architecture with dedicated files for each node has significantly improved:

   - Code organization and readability
   - Test isolation and specificity
   - Maintainability and extensibility
   - Clarity of responsibility

2. **Topological Sorting for Dependencies**: Using topological sorting for section dependencies ensures:

   - Sections are generated in the correct order
   - No circular dependencies can occur
   - The system is extensible to new section types
   - Generation order is deterministic

3. **Structured Output Parsing**: Using Zod schemas for structured output parsing provides:

   - Type-safe extraction of LLM outputs
   - Clear validation errors for debugging
   - Documentation of expected output formats
   - Runtime validation matching TypeScript types

4. **Context Window Management**: Managing context windows for LLM inputs ensures:

   - Reliable operation with large documents
   - Optimal use of the LLM's context window
   - Prioritization of the most relevant information
   - Graceful handling of oversized inputs

5. **Token Refresh Benefits**: Our token refresh approach provides:
   - Enhanced security by detecting and handling expired tokens
   - Improved user experience through proactive refresh before expiration
   - Clear client-side integration patterns
   - Standardized error handling for authentication

   - Comprehensive error handling for invalid tokens

2. **Token Expiration Detection**:

   - Calculates remaining time until token expiration
   - Adds expiration metadata to the request object:
     - `req.tokenExpiresIn`: Seconds until token expiration
     - `req.tokenRefreshRecommended`: Boolean flag for tokens nearing expiration
   - Flags tokens close to expiration for proactive refresh (10-minute threshold)
   - Automatically sets `X-Token-Refresh-Recommended` header for at-risk tokens
   - Special handling for already expired tokens with `refresh_required` flag

3. **Edge Case Handling**:

   - Graceful handling of missing session data
   - Proper handling of tokens with missing expiration timestamp
   - Consistent error messages for different failure modes

- ✅ Valid token authentication tests
- ✅ Invalid token rejection tests
- ✅ Expired token handling tests
- ✅ Missing auth header tests
- ✅ Token expiration calculation tests
- ✅ Edge case handling tests (missing session data, missing expiration time)
- ✅ Error response structure tests
- ✅ Integration with document loading tests
- ✅ Route handler token refresh header tests

### Implementation Insights

1. **Functional Decomposition**: Breaking down the middleware into focused helper functions improved code readability and maintainability.

2. **Standardized Error Responses**: Using a consistent error response structure makes it easier for clients to handle different authentication scenarios.

3. **Proactive Token Refresh**: Detecting tokens close to expiration allows for a better user experience by preventing unexpected session terminations.

6. **TDD Approach Benefits**: Following a Test-Driven Development approach led to cleaner code, better separation of concerns, and more comprehensive test coverage.

## Active Development Context

## Chat UI Integration (Current Focus)

We're implementing a direct port of the existing standalone LangGraph Chat UI app (`../agent-chat-ui`) into our application. The Chat UI is already a working app, so our focus is on integrating it rather than building from scratch.

Key progress so far:

- Created the test infrastructure for TDD approach
- Set up the core component structure for the Thread component
- Implemented the basic providers (Stream, Thread) with the necessary functionality
- Added message components for human and AI messages
- All basic tests are now passing

The directory structure we've established mirrors the source Chat UI app:

- `/apps/web/src/components/chat-ui/thread` - Main Thread component and message rendering
- `/apps/web/src/components/chat-ui/providers` - Stream and Thread context providers
- `/apps/web/src/components/chat-ui/lib` - Shared types and utilities
- `/apps/web/src/__tests__/chat-ui` - Tests for the Chat UI components

Additional integration work remains to connect the UI with our backend services, authentication system, and navigation. We're taking a test-driven approach to ensure components work correctly before connecting to real data sources.

Next steps:

- Create the Chat page to host the Thread component
- Set up the API proxy for LangGraph
- Integrate with authentication
- Connect with the navigation and routing

## Current Tasks and Focus

We're following the integration plan in `chat-int.md` and test scenarios in `chat-cases.md`, implementing in phases:

1. Environment Setup and Dependencies
2. Core Component Extraction (Current)
3. Authentication Integration
4. Navigation and Routing Integration
5. Backend Integration
6. Testing and Refinement

## Chat UI Integration Progress (2024-06)

Phase 2 of the Chat UI integration is complete. All UI components and utilities have been implemented in their correct locations. The next phase will focus on backend integration, tool call handling, and UI polish. Linter errors for missing dependencies must be resolved as part of this work.
