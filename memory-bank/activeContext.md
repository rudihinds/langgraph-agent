## Current Focus: HITL Implementation

The Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) implementation is now complete. Key components include:

1. **Orchestrator Service**:

   - Implemented methods for handling interrupts (`getInterruptStatus`)
   - Added feedback processing (`submitFeedback`)
   - Created methods for resuming after feedback (`resumeAfterFeedback`)
   - Standardized method signatures for consistency

2. **API Endpoints**:

   - Refactored to follow Express.js patterns
   - Implemented factory function (`getOrchestrator`) for consistent instantiation
   - Added proper validation using Zod
   - Fixed response structures across endpoints

3. **Testing Status**:
   - Created unit tests for Orchestrator methods and API endpoints
   - Implemented integration tests for the full HITL workflow
   - Identified remaining issues in dependency order:
     - Package dependencies (supertest)
     - Type definitions
     - Module resolution
     - Test mock updates

The HITL implementation now allows for seamless user intervention during proposal generation:

- The system pauses after evaluation nodes
- Users can review and provide feedback
- The system processes feedback and continues generation
- All state transitions are tracked properly

Next steps include fixing the remaining test issues, enhancing test coverage for edge cases, improving documentation, and implementing performance testing.

## Recent Changes

### HITL Workflow Implementation

- Fixed the `OrchestratorService.submitFeedback` method signature to match the test expectations. It now takes two parameters: `threadId` and a feedback object.
- Updated the feedback API endpoint to pass the correct parameters to the `submitFeedback` method.
- Fixed the `prepareFeedbackForProcessing` method to use the FeedbackType enum and apply the correct status updates:
  - "approved" status for approval feedback
  - "edited" status for revision feedback
  - "stale" status for regeneration feedback
- Restored the `resumeAfterFeedback` method to properly handle graph resumption after feedback processing
- Restored the `getInterruptStatus` method that was missing
- Fixed API endpoints to properly instantiate the OrchestratorService with the required graph and checkpointer parameters

### API Endpoint Fixes

- Updated all API endpoints to use the `createProposalAgentWithCheckpointer` function to create a properly configured graph instance
- Ensured that the OrchestratorService is instantiated with both the graph and its checkpointer
- Alignment of parameter names between the API, service methods, and test expectations

## Next Steps

- Address remaining type errors in the OrchestratorService
- Implement any missing edge cases in the HITL workflow
- Add more comprehensive tests for the feedback handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- We need to ensure that the status transitions in response to feedback are properly handled
- The HITL workflow should be resilient to errors and unexpected states
- API endpoints need to be consistent in how they create and use the OrchestratorService

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- The OrchestratorService is central to the HITL workflow, coordinating between the graph, checkpointer, and user feedback
- Feedback handling should follow a consistent pattern:
  1. Detect interrupt → Get interrupt details → Process feedback → Resume graph
  2. Status transitions should be explicit and predictable
  3. State updates should be immutable

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The HITL workflow requires careful coordination between multiple components
- Tests are essential for verifying that the workflow behaves as expected under different feedback scenarios
- Type safety is important, especially for complex state objects like OverallProposalState
