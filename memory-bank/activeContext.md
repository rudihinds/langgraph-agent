# Active Context - July 29, 2023

## Current Focus: Graph Structure Refinement (Task #14)

We are actively working on refactoring the LangGraph agent backend according to the specifications outlined in `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENT_BASESPEC.md`. With the persistence layer refactoring complete, the focus shifts to **Task #14: Refactor ProposalGenerationGraph for Architecture Compliance**.

## Recent Changes & Completed Tasks

- **Task #14.3 (Message Truncation): Completed**

  - Fixed `TypeError` in `apps/backend/lib/llm/message-truncation.ts` when handling null input for `truncateMessages`.
  - Updated associated test (`apps/backend/lib/llm/__tests__/message-truncation.test.ts`) to correctly expect `MODERATE` truncation level based on test inputs.
  - Marked subtask 14.3 as 'done'.

- **Code Synchronization:**

  - Staged all recent changes.
  - Committed changes with message `fix(llm): Handle null input in message truncation and adjust test` (Ref: Task #14.3).
  - Successfully pushed the `feature/code-cleanup-typescript` branch to the remote repository.

- **Task #11 (State Management Alignment): Completed**

  - Aligned `ProposalState` interface in `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts` with architectural specs.
  - Implemented necessary type definitions (`LoadingStatus`, `ProcessingStatus`, etc.).
  - Defined `ProposalStateAnnotation` using `Annotation.Root` and custom reducers.
  - Added `lastValueReducer`, `createdAtReducer`, `lastUpdatedAtReducer` helper functions.
  - Implemented and enhanced Zod schema (`ProposalStateSchema`) for runtime validation, particularly for the `sections` map.
  - Committed changes: `feat(state): align ProposalState with spec, add reducers & Zod schema (Task #11)`

- **Task #13 (Persistence Layer Refinement): Completed**
  - Implemented `ICheckpointer` interface and `SupabaseCheckpointer` class.
  - Defined database schema (`db-schema.sql`) for checkpoints and sessions.
  - Implemented Row Level Security policies for data protection.
  - Ensured TypeScript compatibility and error handling.

## Immediate Next Steps

- **Task #14.2 (Implement Routing Functions)**

  - Develop the comprehensive routing system based on state and conditions.

- **Task #14.4 (Implement Conditional Edges)**
  - Define and implement the conditional edges within the graph based on evaluation results, etc.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Code Stability:** Successfully pushed current feature branch, establishing a stable point before diving deeper into database schema changes.
- **Task Focus:** Shifted focus to Task #14 (Graph Structure) now that Task #13 (Persistence) is complete.
- **TypeScript Compatibility:** We've addressed issues with Set iteration that were causing TypeScript errors when targeting lower ECMAScript versions. Using `Array.from()` instead of the spread operator (`[...set]`) ensures maximum compatibility.
- **Test-First Approach:** We're addressing test files first to ensure our implementation meets the specified interfaces, then fixing implementation files to match. This approach helps catch interface issues early.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Adhere strictly to `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENT_BASESPEC.md`.
- Follow `REFACTOR.md` task order and dependencies.
- Prioritize type safety (using Zod validation where explicit typing fails).
- Maintain clear commit messages linked to tasks.
- Keep files under 300 lines.
- Ensure backward compatibility with various TypeScript/ECMAScript targets.
