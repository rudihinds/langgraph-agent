   - Ensure evaluation result fields exist for all content types
   - Add proper typing for evaluation status transitions
   - Update the `SectionData` interface with consistent evaluation fields

3. Create evaluation configuration files:

   - Implement criteria configuration for each content type
   - Develop standardized evaluation prompts
   - Ensure consistent scoring mechanisms

4. Continue following the TDD approach:
   - Write tests first to establish expected behavior
   - Implement functionality to pass the tests
   - Refactor while maintaining test coverage

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Standardized Evaluation Pattern

We have established a comprehensive evaluation pattern to be used across all evaluation nodes:

1. **Evaluation Result Structure**:

   - Standardized interface with `passed`, `score`, `feedback`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, and `suggestions`
   - Detailed criteria-specific assessments with individual scores and comments
   - Consistent scoring scale (1-10) with clear threshold for passing (≥7)

2. **HITL Integration**:

   - Standardized `interruptStatus` and `interruptMetadata` fields
   - Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review
   - Clear paths for approval or revision requests

3. **State Management**:
   - Consistent state transitions: queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → (approved/revised)
   - Status field naming conventions
   - Clear error propagation

### Test-Driven Development

We continue to follow TDD principles for all node implementations. This approach has proven effective in guiding the development process and ensuring robust implementations with comprehensive test coverage.

### Error Handling Patterns

A consistent error handling pattern has emerged across node implementations:

1. Early validation of required inputs
2. Specific classification of different error types (missing input, LLM API errors, parsing errors)
3. Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
4. State updates to reflect error conditions
5. Preservation of raw responses for debugging

### State Management

The state management follows established patterns:

1. Status transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review/error)
2. Immutable state updates
3. Detailed message logging
4. Clear error propagation

### Naming Consistency

We maintain consistent naming conventions:

- Node functions: camelCase verb-noun format (e.g., `connectionPairsNode`, `evaluateConnectionsNode`)
- Status fields: snake_case (e.g., `connectionsStatus`)
- State fields: camelCase (e.g., `connections`, `solutionResults`)

## Implementation Insights

1. **Evaluation Result Structure**: The standardized `EvaluationResult` interface provides a consistent approach to quality assessment across all content types, enabling meaningful comparisons and setting clear quality thresholds.

2. **HITL Integration**: The evaluation pattern establishes a framework for human-in-the-loop review at critical decision points, ensuring quality control while maintaining a consistent user experience.

3. **Criteria Management**: Loading evaluation criteria from configuration files enables flexibility and adaptability while maintaining consistency in the evaluation approach.

4. **Error Categorization**: We've established a consistent pattern for error categorization and handling across nodes, which should be maintained for future implementations.

5. **State Transitions**: The consistent state transition pattern (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review/error) provides a clear lifecycle for each node's execution and should be maintained.

## Active Context

## Current Focus

Working on implementing and testing the evaluation framework for proposal sections. The framework provides standardized patterns for evaluating content across different sections of the proposal, with consistent state management and human-in-the-loop integration.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented `EvaluationNodeFactory` class and supporting components
- Created content extractors for different section types
- Developed evaluation criteria JSON files
- Fixed mocking issues in test files
- Added comprehensive tests for the evaluation framework components

## Vitest Testing Learnings

We've uncovered several important learnings about effective Vitest testing:

1. **Proper Module Mocking**:

   - `vi.mock()` is hoisted to the top of the file automatically
   - Use `vi.hoisted(() => { return {...} })` to define mocks before they're used in `vi.mock()`
   - When mocking a module with default export, include both `default: {...}` and individual exports
   - ES modules require different mocking approaches than CommonJS modules
   - Always mock path module with both named exports and default export:
     ```typescript
     const pathMock = vi.hoisted(() => ({
       resolve: vi.fn(),
       default: { resolve: vi.fn() },
     }));
     vi.mock("path", () => pathMock);
     ```

2. **TypeScript Type Safety in Tests**:

   - Create test state interfaces that properly match the actual state structure
   - Use type assertions where necessary to satisfy TypeScript without compromising test value
   - Define proper interfaces for test states that match production state structures
   - Import actual state types from the source files when possible
   - For partial test states, consider using type assertions to cast `TestState as OverallProposalState` where needed
   - When targeting specific fields, use explicit indexing notation (e.g., `state.sections['research']`) to avoid type errors

3. **Mocking Best Practices**:

   - Keep mocks simple and focused on the specific needs of each test
   - Reset mocks before/after each test to ensure clean state
   - For path module, ensure both `default.resolve` and `resolve` are mocked
   - Implement mock behavior that matches the expected behavior of production code
   - Use control variables to adjust mock behavior between tests:

     ```typescript
     let mockShouldFail = false;
     const myMock = vi.hoisted(() => ({
       someFunction: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
         if (mockShouldFail) throw new Error("Test error");
         return "success";
       }),
     }));

     beforeEach(() => {
       mockShouldFail = false;
     });
     ```

4. **Testing Implementation Challenges**:

   - Test files can get long - consider splitting into multiple files (e.g., factory tests, content extractor tests)
   - Ensure tests verify actual behavior, not just that mocks were called
   - Test both happy paths and error handling
   - Verify that state transformations are handled correctly
   - Ensure proper error propagation from nested functions
   - For complex node functions, test the individual components separately before testing the node as a whole

5. **Vitest-specific Patterns**:

   - Use `vi.hoisted()` for defining mocks to avoid reference errors
   - Understand hoisting behavior: `vi.mock()` calls are automatically hoisted but the mock implementations need to be defined using `vi.hoisted()`
   - Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to reset mock state between tests
   - Structure tests with nested `describe` blocks for better organization
   - Use `vi.spyOn` for functions that need to be monitored but not completely mocked
   - For Node.js built-ins like `fs` and `path`, create comprehensive mocks that mimic the module's behavior
   - When dealing with complex return types from functions, explicitly type the mock implementations

6. **File System and Path Mocking**:
   - Always use `vi.hoisted()` for fs/path mocks to ensure they're defined before use
   - For `fs` module, mock both the promises API and the callback API if both are used
   - For `path` module, ensure the mock includes both the named exports and the default export
   - When mocking file existence checks, use control variables to simulate different file system states:
     ```typescript
     let fileExists = true;
     const fsMock = vi.hoisted(() => ({
       promises: {
         access: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
           if (!fileExists) throw new Error("File not found");
           return Promise.resolve();
         }),
         readFile: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue("file content"),
       },
     }));
     ```

## Next Steps

1. Update implementation plan with comprehensive test coverage requirements
2. Implement test suite that verifies compatibility with actual state structure
3. Add tests for error handling scenarios
4. Integrate evaluation nodes with the main proposal generation graph
5. Apply the Vitest testing learnings to future test implementations

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Separate test files by logical component (factory, extractors, criteria loading)
- Create proper test state objects that match the actual state structure
- Test both successful and error cases
- Verify state transformations and error propagation
- Use `vi.hoisted()` consistently for all mock definitions
- Reset mock state between tests using `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks

## Learning and Insights

Most difficult aspects of the testing process:

- Getting mocking right with TypeScript and ES modules
- Ensuring tests don't just verify mocks but actual behavior
- Creating test states that properly reflect production state structure
- Balancing comprehensive testing with maintainable test files
- Properly handling hoisting in Vitest to avoid reference errors
- Managing type compatibility between test state objects and production state interfaces
