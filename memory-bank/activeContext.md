- âœ… **Routing Logic**: Proper conditional routing to "awaiting_strategic_priorities"

**Technical Implementation Details**:

**Master Orchestrator Features**:

- RFP complexity analysis (Simple/Medium/Complex)
- Industry classification with confidence levels
- Three workflow approaches (accelerated, standard, comprehensive)
- Strategic priorities query generation for user collaboration
- Early risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Integration with existing HITL patterns

**StateGraph Integration**:

- Added MASTER_ORCHESTRATOR node to proposal generation graph
- Proper routing with routeAfterMasterOrchestrator() function
- HITL interrupt points for user collaboration
- Integration with existing evaluation and generation nodes

**Testing Infrastructure**:

- Fixed vitest path mappings for @/ aliases
- Proper LangGraph mock integration with importOriginal
- Corrected TypeScript type mismatches (ProcessingStatus.COMPLETE, complexityLevel: "moderate")
- Integration tests validating end-to-end master orchestrator flow

**Code Implementation**: âœ… **FUNCTIONAL AND TESTED**

```typescript
// âœ… WORKING: Master orchestrator with RFP analysis
export const masterOrchestratorNode = async (
  state: OverallProposalState
): Promise<Partial<OverallProposalState>> => {
  // Analyze RFP complexity and characteristics
  const rfpAnalysis = await analyzeRFPComplexity(state.rfpDocument.raw);

  // Determine optimal workflow approach
  const workflowDecision = selectWorkflowApproach(rfpAnalysis);

  // Create strategic priorities query for user collaboration
  const strategicQuery = createStrategicPrioritiesQuery(
    rfpAnalysis,
    workflowDecision
  );

  return {
    planningIntelligence: {
      ...state.planningIntelligence,
      rfpCharacteristics: rfpAnalysis,
    },
    adaptiveWorkflow: workflowDecision,
    userCollaboration: {
      ...state.userCollaboration,
      userQueries: [
        ...(state.userCollaboration?.userQueries || []),
        strategicQuery,
      ],
    },
    // Trigger HITL for strategic priorities input
    interruptStatus: {
      isInterrupted: true,
      reason: InterruptReason.CONTENT_REVIEW,
      processingStatus: ProcessingStatus.COMPLETE,
    },
  };
};

// âœ… WORKING: Routing function integrated into graph
export const routeAfterMasterOrchestrator = (
  state: OverallProposalState
): string => {
  const userQueries = state.userCollaboration?.userQueries || [];
  const hasStrategicPriorities = userQueries.some((query) =>
    query.question.toLowerCase().includes("strategic priorities")
  );

  if (hasStrategicPriorities) {
    return "awaiting_strategic_priorities";
  }

  // Default routing logic for agent selection
  const activeAgentSet = state.adaptiveWorkflow?.activeAgentSet || [];
  if (
    activeAgentSet.some((agent) => agent.includes("Enhanced Research Agent"))
  ) {
    return "research";
  }

  return "research"; // Default fallback
};
```

### **ðŸš€ Phase 2 Next Steps - Core Planning Agents:**

**Ready for Implementation**:

1. **Step 2.2: Enhanced Research Node** - Comprehensive funder intelligence gathering
2. **Step 2.3: Industry Specialist Node** - Sector-specific compliance requirements
3. **Step 2.4: Competitive Intelligence Node** - Market landscape analysis
4. **Step 2.5: Requirement Analysis Node** - Systematic requirement extraction
5. **Step 2.6: Evaluation Prediction Node** - Predict actual vs stated evaluation criteria
6. **Step 2.7: Solution Decoder Node** - Synthesize intelligence into solution requirements

## Previous Accomplishments

**Document Parsing System Implementation Complete âœ…**

We successfully implemented a comprehensive document parsing and storage system for RFP documents, establishing proper data relationships and parsing capabilities for multi-page documents.

**Backend Refactoring Complete âœ…**

We successfully completed ALL 5 PHASES of the comprehensive backend refactoring plan outlined in `backend-refactor.md`. The backend is now fully refactored with clean architecture, consolidated configuration, and standardized structure.

## Active Issues & Blockers

- None currently. Master Orchestrator integration is complete and all tests passing.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

**Planning Agent Architecture**:

- **Master Orchestrator**: Central RFP analysis and workflow selection using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **User Collaboration**: Strategic priorities queries with HITL interrupt() functionality
- **StateGraph Integration**: Proper node addition and conditional routing patterns
- **Template Variables**: Extract and populate template variables for dynamic prompts
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests with proper vitest path mapping and LangGraph mocks

**Development Patterns**:

- **ES Module Imports**: Always use .js extensions for imports with TypeScript
- **Path Aliases**: Use @/ aliases instead of complex relative paths
- **Mock Configuration**: Use vi.hoisted() for proper mock setup with vitest
- **Type Safety**: Ensure enum usage matches actual implementation (e.g., ProcessingStatus.COMPLETE)
