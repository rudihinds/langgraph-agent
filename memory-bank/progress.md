## Known Issues

1. The memory bank progress update process occasionally fails to properly update the file.
2. Some tests may be brittle due to complex regex patterns for extracting information from LLM responses.
3. The `OverallProposalState` interface needs updating to fully support the standardized evaluation pattern.
4. Evaluation criteria need to be formalized in configuration files for each content type.
5. Authentication and thread handoff integration needs to be completed according to the plan in `auth-front-back.md`
6. TypeScript linter error in `server.ts` related to `app.use(cookieParser())` (code functions correctly at runtime).
7. Need to verify authentication handling for the direct LangGraph stream connection.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've evolved to a more robust and consistent pattern for error handling across all nodes:

   - Early validation of required inputs
   - Specific classification of different error types
   - Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
   - State updates to reflect error conditions
   - Preservation of raw responses for debugging

2. **TDD Effectiveness**: The Test-Driven Development approach has proven highly effective for implementing complex nodes. Writing comprehensive tests before implementation has helped catch edge cases and ensure robust behavior. This pattern has been successful for all research nodes and will continue to be applied.

3. **Response Format Flexibility**: We've implemented a dual-layer parsing approach (JSON primary, regex fallback) for resilient response handling, which has proven valuable for dealing with LLM outputs that may not always perfectly match the expected format.

4. **Standardized Evaluation Pattern**: We've established a comprehensive evaluation framework with the following key elements:

   - **Structured Evaluation Results**: Standardized interface with overall assessment (pass/fail, score) and detailed feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions)
   - **Criteria-Based Assessment**: Evaluation against explicit criteria with individual scoring and feedback
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review using LangGraph interrupts
   - **State Management**: Clear state transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → approved/revised)
   - **Conditional Routing**: Standard pattern for routing based on evaluation results and user feedback

5. **Content Quality Standards**: We've established a consistent quality threshold (score ≥7) for auto-approval of generated content, with clear paths for human review and revision.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interruption Pattern**: We've successfully implemented the HITL pattern in all evaluation nodes:

   - Standardized `interruptMetadata` with contextual information about the evaluation
   - Consistent `interruptStatus` field for managing the interruption state
   - Clear integration points for human feedback via the OrchestratorService

7. **Document Loading Strategy**: We've implemented a robust approach for document handling:

   - Fallback chain for document ID resolution (state → environment → default)
   - Format-agnostic document processing (supports PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
   - Consistent state updates to track document status

8. **Authentication and Token Refresh Strategy**: We've implemented a comprehensive approach for authentication:

   - Token validation with detailed error handling for different failure modes
   - Proactive token expiration detection with a 10-minute threshold
   - Token refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration
   - Special handling for expired tokens with clear client guidance
   - Standardized error response structure for authentication failures

9. **Authentication and Thread Handoff Strategy**: We've created a comprehensive plan for integrating frontend authentication with the LangGraph backend:
   - Clear separation of concerns between authentication and thread management
   - Proper token refresh handling for long-running sessions
   - User-specific thread access control
   - Graceful error handling and loading states
10. **Chat UI Connection**: Moved from an API passthrough proxy to a direct connection from the frontend (`StreamProvider`) to the LangGraph streaming endpoint, simplifying the architecture and aligning with reference examples.

## Current Status

- The dependency chain management system is now working correctly:

  - When a section is edited, dependent sections are automatically marked as stale
  - Users can choose to keep the stale sections as-is or regenerate them
  - The regeneration process can include guidance for improvement
  - The system tracks which sections depend on others via a configuration file

- The research phase nodes are now fully implemented:

  - Document loading from Supabase storage
  - Deep research analysis of RFP documents
  - Solution sought identification
  - Connection pairs between funder priorities and applicant capabilities
  - Standardized evaluation for all research outputs with HITL integration

- The RFP integration feature is now fully implemented:

  - Document loading with rfpId support
  - Fallback mechanisms for document ID resolution
  - Format-agnostic document processing
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Context-aware chat responses
  - All tests passing

- The authentication middleware has been enhanced:

  - Token refresh handling with expiration detection and calculation
  - Proactive refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration (10-minute threshold)
  - Special handling for expired tokens with refresh_required flag
  - Consistent error response structure for all auth scenarios
  - Resilient edge case handling for missing session data and expiration timestamps
  - Detailed logging for security auditing
  - Comprehensive documentation with client-side integration patterns
  - All tests passing, including edge cases

- **Chat UI Connection**: Refactored to use direct connection to LangGraph (`http://localhost:2024`). Basic message sending and receiving is functional. UI correctly isolated to the chat page.

## Next Steps

1. Test Chat UI thoroughly (tool calls, interrupts, long conversations).
2. Verify message display for all types in the UI.
3. Confirm authentication flow for direct LangGraph connection.
4. Improve error handling in `StreamProvider`.
5. Continue implementation of core `ProposalGenerationGraph` nodes.

## Insights

- Adapter pattern for checkpointing ensures future-proofing against LangGraph API changes
- Robust state management, HITL, and persistence are in place
- Project is on track for backend integration and final polish phases
- Simplifying the chat connection aligns better with LangGraph examples and reduces potential points of failure.
