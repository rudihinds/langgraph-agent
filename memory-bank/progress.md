# Project Progress - Proposal Agent Development

## What Works / Recently Completed

### Phase 1: Backend - Singleton Checkpointer Factory for LangGraph Server

- **Step 1.1: Implement Singleton Checkpointer Factory:** ✅ Completed.
  - Refactored `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` with `getInitializedCheckpointer`.
  - Ensures `PostgresSaver.setup()` is called only once.
  - Corrected TypeScript type error for `pgPoolInstance`.
- **Step 1.2: Utilize Singleton Checkpointer in Graph Compilation:** ✅ Completed.
  - Updated `createProposalGenerationGraph` in `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` to use `getInitializedCheckpointer`.
- **Step 1.3: Verify `langgraph.json` and Server Startup:** ✅ Partially Completed.
  - `langgraph.json` verified to point to `createProposalGenerationGraph`.
  - **User Task:** Manually test LangGraph server startup and check logs.

### Phase 2: Backend - Application Association Layer (Express Server - Port 3001)

- **Step 2.1: Define `user_rfp_proposal_threads` Table:** ✅ Completed.
  - SQL DDL defined and applied via Supabase migration. Table `user_rfp_proposal_threads` created.
- **Step 2.2: Create `ProposalThreadAssociationService`:** ✅ Completed.
  - `apps/backend/services/proposalThreadAssociation.service.ts` created.
  - Service methods `recordNewProposalThread` and `listUserProposalThreads` implemented.
  - Supabase client import updated to use `serverSupabase` (service role client).
- **Step 2.3: Create API Endpoints for Thread Association:** ✅ Completed.
  - Implemented `POST /api/rfp/proposal_threads` (records new thread association; validates input, authenticates user, calls service).
  - Implemented `GET /api/rfp/proposal_threads` (lists user threads; optional rfpId filter; authenticates user, calls service).
  - Endpoints are protected by auth middleware and use Zod for validation.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus from `final_threads_setup.md`)

1.  **Phase 2, Step 2.4: Re-evaluate `OrchestratorService` and `checkpointer.service.ts`:**
    - Analyze and refactor these services to align with the new architecture.
2.  **Phase 3: Frontend - `thread_id` Generation and SDK Interaction:** (All steps)
3.  **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement:** (All steps)

## Current Status

- Core backend infrastructure for singleton checkpointer management in the LangGraph server is in place.
- The database table and service layer for managing application-level thread associations (`user_id`, `rfp_id`, `app_generated_thread_id`) are implemented.
- **API endpoints for thread association are now live and ready for frontend integration.**
- **Known Issue:** A linter error exists in `ProposalThreadAssociationService` due to the missing Supabase `database.types.ts` file. This is blocked by the user needing to install the Supabase CLI to generate these types.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Confirmed the necessity of a singleton `PostgresSaver` and its `setup()` being called only once.
- Solidified the architecture: frontend generates `app_generated_thread_id`, Express backend records association, LangGraph server uses this ID for its checkpointer.
- Identified `serverSupabase` (service role) as the appropriate client for backend database services.

# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is focused on implementing the core nodes of the `ProposalGenerationGraph` for the Proposal Generator Agent.

### Completed

1. **Project Infrastructure**: Set up the monorepo structure, core libraries, and test frameworks.

   - Created mocking utilities for LLM responses
   - Implemented both unit and integration tests
4. **Evaluation Framework**:
   - Defined standardized evaluation pattern for all evaluator nodes
   - Created consistent `EvaluationResult` interface with multi-dimensional assessment
   - Implemented human-in-the-loop (HITL) review pattern using interrupts
   - Documented the pattern in `evaluation_pattern_documentation.md`
5. **RFP Integration Feature**:
   - ✅ Enhanced document loader with rfpId support
   - ✅ Implemented fallback mechanism for document ID resolution
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for document loading
   - ✅ Created context-aware chat responses based on document status
   - ✅ All RFP integration tests are now passing
6. **Authentication Middleware Enhancement**:
   - ✅ Implemented token refresh handling in the auth middleware
   - ✅ Added proactive token expiration detection with 10-minute threshold
   - ✅ Created standardized response format for expired tokens with refresh_required flag
   - ✅ Added token expiration metadata to the request object
   - ✅ Implemented resilient edge case handling for missing session data and expiration timestamps
   - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation and README.md for the middleware

7. **Chat UI Integration & Refactoring**: Integrated core chat UI components and refactored the connection to use a direct LangGraph endpoint, removing the API proxy. Provider structure corrected.
8. **Server Architecture and Checkpointing Refactor**:
   - Consolidated server startup to use `apps/backend/server.ts` as the main entry point, which initializes LangGraph components and then starts the Express application configured in `apps/backend/api/express-server.ts`.
   - Simplified persistence by removing custom checkpointer adapters and factory. Now exclusively using the official `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` (`PostgresSaver`) via `createRobustCheckpointer` (which also handles DB schema setup), with a fallback to `MemorySaver`.
   - Centralized `thread_id` management within the `OrchestratorService` and API layer for all graph operations.
   - Removed redundant server startup files (`apps/backend/index.ts`, `apps/backend/server.js`) and custom persistence components.

### Next

1. **Authentication Integration Phase**

   - Update StreamProvider with session token handling
   - Add token refresh logic
   - Configure API proxy for auth headers

2. **Thread Management Phase**

   - Add authentication checks
   - Create integration tests

## Known Issues

1. The memory bank progress update process occasionally fails to properly update the file.
2. Some tests may be brittle due to complex regex patterns for extracting information from LLM responses.
3. The `OverallProposalState` interface needs updating to fully support the standardized evaluation pattern.
4. Evaluation criteria need to be formalized in configuration files for each content type.
5. Authentication and thread handoff integration needs to be completed according to the plan in `auth-front-back.md`
6. TypeScript linter error in `server.ts` related to `app.use(cookieParser())` (code functions correctly at runtime).
7. Need to verify authentication handling for the direct LangGraph stream connection.
8. Unit testing persistence side-effects for methods like `OrchestratorService.addUserMessage` is challenging with current mocking strategies and may require integration testing for full verification.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've evolved to a more robust and consistent pattern for error handling across all nodes:

   - Early validation of required inputs
   - Specific classification of different error types
   - Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
   - State updates to reflect error conditions
   - Preservation of raw responses for debugging

2. **TDD Effectiveness**: The Test-Driven Development approach has proven highly effective for implementing complex nodes. Writing comprehensive tests before implementation has helped catch edge cases and ensure robust behavior. This pattern has been successful for all research nodes and will continue to be applied.

3. **Response Format Flexibility**: We've implemented a dual-layer parsing approach (JSON primary, regex fallback) for resilient response handling, which has proven valuable for dealing with LLM outputs that may not always perfectly match the expected format.

4. **Standardized Evaluation Pattern**: We've established a comprehensive evaluation framework with the following key elements:

   - **Structured Evaluation Results**: Standardized interface with overall assessment (pass/fail, score) and detailed feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions)
   - **Criteria-Based Assessment**: Evaluation against explicit criteria with individual scoring and feedback
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review using LangGraph interrupts
   - **State Management**: Clear state transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → approved/revised)
   - **Conditional Routing**: Standard pattern for routing based on evaluation results and user feedback

5. **Content Quality Standards**: We've established a consistent quality threshold (score ≥7) for auto-approval of generated content, with clear paths for human review and revision.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interruption Pattern**: We've successfully implemented the HITL pattern in all evaluation nodes:

   - Standardized `interruptMetadata` with contextual information about the evaluation
   - Consistent `interruptStatus` field for managing the interruption state
   - Clear integration points for human feedback via the OrchestratorService

7. **Document Loading Strategy**: We've implemented a robust approach for document handling:

   - Fallback chain for document ID resolution (state → environment → default)
   - Format-agnostic document processing (supports PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
   - Consistent state updates to track document status

8. **Authentication and Token Refresh Strategy**: We've implemented a comprehensive approach for authentication:

   - Token validation with detailed error handling for different failure modes
   - Proactive token expiration detection with a 10-minute threshold
   - Token refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration
   - Special handling for expired tokens with clear client guidance
   - Standardized error response structure for authentication failures

9. **Authentication and Thread Handoff Strategy**: We've created a comprehensive plan for integrating frontend authentication with the LangGraph backend:
   - Clear separation of concerns between authentication and thread management
   - Proper token refresh handling for long-running sessions
   - User-specific thread access control
   - Graceful error handling and loading states
10. **Chat UI Connection**: Moved from an API passthrough proxy to a direct connection from the frontend (`StreamProvider`) to the LangGraph streaming endpoint, simplifying the architecture and aligning with reference examples.
11. **Server Architecture & Persistence**: Shifted from custom checkpointer adapters to the official `PostgresSaver` from `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` to improve maintainability, reduce custom code, and leverage official schema management. Streamlined server startup by designating `server.ts` as the primary entry point that orchestrates asynchronous initialization and utilizes a separately configured Express app from `express-server.ts`.

- **Server & Checkpointer Refactor**: Streamlined server startup logic, consolidated checkpointer implementation to use official `PostgresSaver`, and removed redundant files.

## Current Status

- The dependency chain management system is now working correctly:

  - When a section is edited, dependent sections are automatically marked as stale
  - Users can choose to keep the stale sections as-is or regenerate them
  - The regeneration process can include guidance for improvement
  - The system tracks which sections depend on others via a configuration file

- The research phase nodes are now fully implemented:

  - Document loading from Supabase storage
  - Deep research analysis of RFP documents
  - Solution sought identification
  - Connection pairs between funder priorities and applicant capabilities
  - Standardized evaluation for all research outputs with HITL integration

- The RFP integration feature is now fully implemented:

  - Document loading with rfpId support
  - Fallback mechanisms for document ID resolution
  - Format-agnostic document processing
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Context-aware chat responses
  - All tests passing

- The authentication middleware has been enhanced:

  - Token refresh handling with expiration detection and calculation
  - Proactive refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration (10-minute threshold)
  - Special handling for expired tokens with refresh_required flag
  - Consistent error response structure for all auth scenarios
  - Resilient edge case handling for missing session data and expiration timestamps
  - Detailed logging for security auditing
  - Comprehensive documentation with client-side integration patterns
  - All tests passing, including edge cases

- **Chat UI Connection**: Refactored to use direct connection to LangGraph (`http://localhost:2024`). Basic message sending and receiving is functional. UI correctly isolated to the chat page.
- **Chat UI Rendering**: Basic message rendering (human and AI) is working correctly after resolving issues with `react-markdown` and conditional rendering logic.

- **Server Architecture**: The backend server now has a clear startup sequence managed by `server.ts`, leveraging a configured Express app from `express-server.ts`. Persistence is handled by `PostgresSaver`.

## Next Steps

1. Test Chat UI thoroughly (tool calls, interrupts, long conversations).
2. Verify message display for all types in the UI.
3. Confirm authentication flow for direct LangGraph connection.
4. Improve error handling in `StreamProvider`.
5. Continue implementation of core `ProposalGenerationGraph` nodes.

## Insights

- Adapter pattern for checkpointing ensures future-proofing against LangGraph API changes
- Robust state management, HITL, and persistence are in place
- Project is on track for backend integration and final polish phases
- Simplifying the chat connection aligns better with LangGraph examples and reduces potential points of failure.

## What's Left to Build / Fix

- **Resolve Test 3 Failure:** Fix the failing test for `addUserMessage` persistence in `thread-persistence.test.ts`. This requires addressing the challenge of verifying state after `graph.invoke` in a unit test context.
- **Implement Test 4:** Write and run the test for thread isolation.
- **Database Schema/RLS Verification (Phase 5.4.6):** Connect to Supabase, confirm `checkpoints` table schema, and configure Row Level Security.
- **End-to-End Testing (Phase 5.4.7):** Manually test the full user flow (new proposal, chat, refresh, resume).
- **Documentation (Phase 5.5):** Update API docs, developer guidelines, UI docs, deployment checklist, performance recommendations.

## Current Status

- Checkpoint refactoring (Phase 5) is nearing completion.
- Backend persistence layer is modernized using `PostgresSaver`.
- Frontend is integrated with the new backend API for thread management.
- **Currently Blocked/Working On:** Resolving the unit testing challenge for state persistence verification in `thread-persistence.test.ts` (Test 3).

## Known Issues

- Unit testing the final persisted state after orchestrator methods like `addUserMessage` is unreliable with the current mocking strategy.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Shifted from custom `SupabaseCheckpointer` to official `PostgresSaver`:** Reduces maintenance and aligns with LangGraph standards.
- **Adopted deterministic `thread_id` pattern:** Simplifies thread lookup and management compared to previous UUID mapping (`ThreadService` is now deprecated).
- **Centralized workflow logic in `OrchestratorService`:** Provides a clear control point for graph interactions.

## Phase 3: Frontend - `thread_id` Generation and SDK Interaction

**Goal:** Implement frontend logic to generate `thread_id`s, record associations via the Express backend, and correctly use these `thread_id`s when interacting with the LangGraph server.

- **Step 3.1: Frontend Environment Configuration:** ✅ (Verified)
- **Step 3.2: UUID Generation Utility:** ✅ (Completed - `uuid` package installed and used directly)
- **Step 3.3: Implement "Start New Proposal" Flow:** ✅ (Completed)
  - **API Client (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`):** `recordNewProposalThread` function: ✅
  - **Frontend Provider Logic (`StreamProvider.tsx`, `ThreadProvider.tsx`):** Core logic for new thread initiation and association: ✅
- **Step 3.4: Implement "Continue/Select Existing Proposal" Flow:** ✅ (Completed)
  - **API Client (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`):** `listUserProposalThreads` function: ✅
  - **Frontend Provider Logic (`ThreadProvider.tsx`):** Fetching and managing `applicationThreads`: ✅
  - **URL-driven loading via `StreamProvider.tsx`**: ✅
- **Step 3.5: LangGraph SDK Integration Review:** ✅ (Completed)
  - Verified `StreamProvider.tsx` correctly passes `thread_id` to SDK calls.
- **Step 3.6: Implement Frontend UI for Thread Management and Selection:** ✅ (Completed)
  - New UI components (`ProposalThreadsList.tsx`, `ProposalListItem.tsx`) created in `apps/web/src/features/thread/components/`.
  - UI integrated into `AgentProvidersWrapper.tsx` as a sidebar for chat pages.
  - UI allows listing threads, selecting existing threads (updates URL), and starting new proposals for an RFP (updates URL to trigger `StreamProvider`).

**Note on Deprecated Express Endpoints (Feedback/Resume/Interrupt):**
Express backend API endpoints `/api/rfp/feedback`, `/api/rfp/resume`, and `/api/rfp/interrupt-status` have been temporarily disabled (return 503) due to reliance on a deprecated orchestrator model. These require future refactoring to work with the LangGraph server's HITL capabilities. Files affected: `apps/backend/api/rfp/feedback.ts`, `resume.ts`, `interrupt-status.ts`.

## Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

**Goal:** Thoroughly validate the entire integrated system.

- **Step 4.1: Test Singleton Checkpointer Initialization:** ◻️ (Not Started)
- **Step 4.2: Test Frontend and Backend API Flows:** ◻️ (Not Started)
- **Step 4.3: Test LangGraph Persistence with Application `thread_id`:** ◻️ (Not Started)
- **Step 4.4: Comprehensive Error Handling:** ◻️ (Not Started)

## What's Left to Build

- **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement** (All steps).
- Future refactor of deprecated Express backend HITL-related API endpoints (`feedback`, `resume`, `interrupt-status`).

## Current Status

- Phase 1 (Backend Singleton Checkpointer) is ✅ Completed.
- Phase 2 (Backend Application Association Layer) is ✅ Completed.
- Phase 3 (Frontend `thread_id` Generation, SDK Interaction, and UI) is ✅ Completed.
- The system is now ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing (Phase 4).
- Identified backend API endpoints (`feedback`, `resume`, `interrupt-status`) that are temporarily disabled and require future refactoring.

## API Routing and Persistence Stability:

- Resolved a series of 404 errors related to API routing and LangGraph checkpointer initialization.
- Frontend requests to the Express backend (e.g., `POST /api/rfp/proposal_threads`) are now correctly routed and handled.
- Frontend requests to the LangGraph server (e.g., `POST /threads/.../history`) are reaching the server.
- The LangGraph `PostgresSaver` checkpointer is now correctly initializing and creating its database tables via the `pgSaver.setup()` call within the `getInitializedCheckpointer` factory. This resolved the "Thread not found" errors from the LangGraph server.
- Clear distinction and correct usage of `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for Express backend) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_API_URL` (for LangGraph server) is established.

## Previous Completions (Phases 1 & 2 of `final_threads_setup.md` up to API endpoints):

- Singleton checkpointer factory (`getInitializedCheckpointer`) for LangGraph server is robust.
- `user_rfp_proposal_threads` table in Supabase for application-level thread association is created.
- `ProposalThreadAssociationService` for managing these associations is implemented.
- API endpoints (`POST` and `GET /api/rfp/proposal_threads`) for thread association are implemented and functional.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus from `final_threads_setup.md` and beyond)

1.  **Phase 2, Step 2.4: Re-evaluate `OrchestratorService` and `checkpointer.service.ts` (Express Backend):**
    - Analyze and refactor these services to align with the current architecture where the LangGraph server manages its own checkpointer and the Express backend handles application-level thread association and orchestration tasks that don't directly involve running graph steps (e.g., initiating a new graph run, interpreting HITL feedback for state updates outside the graph flow).
2.  **Phase 3: Frontend - `thread_id` Generation and SDK Interaction:**
    - Implement frontend logic for generating `app_generated_thread_id`.
    - Ensure frontend calls the new `/api/rfp/proposal_threads` endpoint to record association before interacting with LangGraph.
    - Ensure frontend uses the `app_generated_thread_id` when interacting with the LangGraph server SDK.
3.  **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement:**
    - Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of the entire proposal creation, interaction, and persistence flow.
    - Test HITL scenarios with the new setup.
    - Verify multi-tenancy and user-specific data isolation.
4.  **Continue `ProposalGenerationGraph` Node Implementations:** Resume work on core graph nodes once the foundational persistence and API layers are fully stable and tested.

## Current Status

- The core API routing and LangGraph persistence mechanisms are now believed to be stable and correctly configured.
- The system can successfully record application-level thread associations.
- The LangGraph server can successfully persist and retrieve thread states using its `PostgresSaver` checkpointer.
- **Next major steps involve:**

  - Refactoring the Express backend's `OrchestratorService` to work with the now independent LangGraph server's state.
  - Integrating the frontend to correctly generate and use the `app_generated_thread_id` for both Express backend association and LangGraph server interaction.

- **Known Issue (User Task):** Linter error in `ProposalThreadAssociationService` due to missing Supabase `database.types.ts` file. User needs to install Supabase CLI to generate these types.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **API Routing:** Refined understanding of how Express sub-routers and base paths interact. Ensured internal API prefixes are not duplicated if already handled by environment variables or primary router configurations.
- **LangGraph Persistence:** Confirmed the critical role of `PostgresSaver.setup()` and ensured it's reliably called via our `getInitializedCheckpointer` factory. Shifted to relying on the library for its table creation rather than manual DDL for checkpointer tables.
- **Environment Variables:** Clarified the specific roles of `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` vs. `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_API_URL` for frontend configuration.
