# Project Progress - Proposal Agent Development

## What Works / Recently Completed

### Phase 1: Backend - Singleton Checkpointer Factory for LangGraph Server

- **Step 1.1: Implement Singleton Checkpointer Factory:** ✅ Completed.
  - Refactored `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` with `getInitializedCheckpointer`.
  - Ensures `PostgresSaver.setup()` is called only once.
  - Corrected TypeScript type error for `pgPoolInstance`.
- **Step 1.2: Utilize Singleton Checkpointer in Graph Compilation:** ✅ Completed.
  - Updated `createProposalGenerationGraph` in `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` to use `getInitializedCheckpointer`.
- **Step 1.3: Verify `langgraph.json` and Server Startup:** ✅ Partially Completed.
  - `langgraph.json` verified to point to `createProposalGenerationGraph`.
  - **User Task:** Manually test LangGraph server startup and check logs.

### Phase 2: Backend - Application Association Layer (Express Server - Port 3001)

- **Step 2.1: Define `user_rfp_proposal_threads` Table:** ✅ Completed.
  - SQL DDL defined and applied via Supabase migration. Table `user_rfp_proposal_threads` created.
- **Step 2.2: Create `ProposalThreadAssociationService`:** ✅ Completed.
  - `apps/backend/services/proposalThreadAssociation.service.ts` created.
  - Service methods `recordNewProposalThread` and `listUserProposalThreads` implemented.
  - Supabase client import updated to use `serverSupabase` (service role client).
- **Step 2.3: Create API Endpoints for Thread Association:** ✅ Completed.
  - Implemented `POST /api/rfp/proposal_threads` (records new thread association; validates input, authenticates user, calls service).
  - Implemented `GET /api/rfp/proposal_threads` (lists user threads; optional rfpId filter; authenticates user, calls service).
  - Endpoints are protected by auth middleware and use Zod for validation.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus from `final_threads_setup.md`)

1.  **Phase 2, Step 2.4: Re-evaluate `OrchestratorService` and `checkpointer.service.ts`:**
    - Analyze and refactor these services to align with the new architecture.
2.  **Phase 3: Frontend - `thread_id` Generation and SDK Interaction:** (All steps)
3.  **Phase 4: Testing and Refinement:** (All steps)

## Current Status

- Core backend infrastructure for singleton checkpointer management in the LangGraph server is in place.
- The database table and service layer for managing application-level thread associations (`user_id`, `rfp_id`, `app_generated_thread_id`) are implemented.
- **API endpoints for thread association are now live and ready for frontend integration.**
- **Known Issue:** A linter error exists in `ProposalThreadAssociationService` due to the missing Supabase `database.types.ts` file. This is blocked by the user needing to install the Supabase CLI to generate these types.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Confirmed the necessity of a singleton `PostgresSaver` and its `setup()` being called only once.
- Solidified the architecture: frontend generates `app_generated_thread_id`, Express backend records association, LangGraph server uses this ID for its checkpointer.
- Identified `serverSupabase` (service role) as the appropriate client for backend database services.

# Project Progress

   - Created mocking utilities for LLM responses
   - Implemented both unit and integration tests
4. **Evaluation Framework**:
   - Defined standardized evaluation pattern for all evaluator nodes
   - Created consistent `EvaluationResult` interface with multi-dimensional assessment
   - Implemented human-in-the-loop (HITL) review pattern using interrupts
   - Documented the pattern in `evaluation_pattern_documentation.md`
5. **RFP Integration Feature**:
   - ✅ Enhanced document loader with rfpId support
   - ✅ Implemented fallback mechanism for document ID resolution
   - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for document loading
   - ✅ Created context-aware chat responses based on document status
   - ✅ All RFP integration tests are now passing
6. **Authentication Middleware Enhancement**:
   - ✅ Implemented token refresh handling in the auth middleware
   - ✅ Added proactive token expiration detection with 10-minute threshold
   - ✅ Created standardized response format for expired tokens with refresh_required flag
   - ✅ Added token expiration metadata to the request object

   - Simplified persistence by removing custom checkpointer adapters and factory. Now exclusively using the official `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` (`PostgresSaver`) via `createRobustCheckpointer` (which also handles DB schema setup), with a fallback to `MemorySaver`.
   - Centralized `thread_id` management within the `OrchestratorService` and API layer for all graph operations.
   - Removed redundant server startup files (`apps/backend/index.ts`, `apps/backend/server.js`) and custom persistence components.

### Next

1. **Authentication Integration Phase**

   - Update StreamProvider with session token handling
   - Add token refresh logic
   - Configure API proxy for auth headers

2. **Thread Management Phase**

   - Create integration tests

## Known Issues

1. The memory bank progress update process occasionally fails to properly update the file.
2. Some tests may be brittle due to complex regex patterns for extracting information from LLM responses.
3. The `OverallProposalState` interface needs updating to fully support the standardized evaluation pattern.
4. Evaluation criteria need to be formalized in configuration files for each content type.
5. Authentication and thread handoff integration needs to be completed according to the plan in `auth-front-back.md`
6. TypeScript linter error in `server.ts` related to `app.use(cookieParser())` (code functions correctly at runtime).
7. Need to verify authentication handling for the direct LangGraph stream connection.
8. Unit testing persistence side-effects for methods like `OrchestratorService.addUserMessage` is challenging with current mocking strategies and may require integration testing for full verification.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've evolved to a more robust and consistent pattern for error handling across all nodes:

   - Early validation of required inputs
   - Specific classification of different error types
   - Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
   - State updates to reflect error conditions
   - Preservation of raw responses for debugging

2. **TDD Effectiveness**: The Test-Driven Development approach has proven highly effective for implementing complex nodes. Writing comprehensive tests before implementation has helped catch edge cases and ensure robust behavior. This pattern has been successful for all research nodes and will continue to be applied.

3. **Response Format Flexibility**: We've implemented a dual-layer parsing approach (JSON primary, regex fallback) for resilient response handling, which has proven valuable for dealing with LLM outputs that may not always perfectly match the expected format.

4. **Standardized Evaluation Pattern**: We've established a comprehensive evaluation framework with the following key elements:

   - **Structured Evaluation Results**: Standardized interface with overall assessment (pass/fail, score) and detailed feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions)
   - **Criteria-Based Assessment**: Evaluation against explicit criteria with individual scoring and feedback
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review using LangGraph interrupts
   - **State Management**: Clear state transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → approved/revised)
   - **Conditional Routing**: Standard pattern for routing based on evaluation results and user feedback

5. **Content Quality Standards**: We've established a consistent quality threshold (score ≥7) for auto-approval of generated content, with clear paths for human review and revision.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interruption Pattern**: We've successfully implemented the HITL pattern in all evaluation nodes:

   - Standardized `interruptMetadata` with contextual information about the evaluation
   - Consistent `interruptStatus` field for managing the interruption state
   - Clear integration points for human feedback via the OrchestratorService

7. **Document Loading Strategy**: We've implemented a robust approach for document handling:

   - Fallback chain for document ID resolution (state → environment → default)
   - Format-agnostic document processing (supports PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
   - Consistent state updates to track document status

8. **Authentication and Token Refresh Strategy**: We've implemented a comprehensive approach for authentication:

   - Token validation with detailed error handling for different failure modes
   - Proactive token expiration detection with a 10-minute threshold
   - Token refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration
   - Special handling for expired tokens with clear client guidance
   - Standardized error response structure for authentication failures

9. **Authentication and Thread Handoff Strategy**: We've created a comprehensive plan for integrating frontend authentication with the LangGraph backend:
   - Clear separation of concerns between authentication and thread management
   - Proper token refresh handling for long-running sessions
   - User-specific thread access control
   - Graceful error handling and loading states
10. **Chat UI Connection**: Moved from an API passthrough proxy to a direct connection from the frontend (`StreamProvider`) to the LangGraph streaming endpoint, simplifying the architecture and aligning with reference examples.
11. **Server Architecture & Persistence**: Shifted from custom checkpointer adapters to the official `PostgresSaver` from `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` to improve maintainability, reduce custom code, and leverage official schema management. Streamlined server startup by designating `server.ts` as the primary entry point that orchestrates asynchronous initialization and utilizes a separately configured Express app from `express-server.ts`.

- **Server & Checkpointer Refactor**: Streamlined server startup logic, consolidated checkpointer implementation to use official `PostgresSaver`, and removed redundant files.

## Current Status

- The dependency chain management system is now working correctly:

  - When a section is edited, dependent sections are automatically marked as stale
  - Users can choose to keep the stale sections as-is or regenerate them
  - The regeneration process can include guidance for improvement
  - The system tracks which sections depend on others via a configuration file

- The research phase nodes are now fully implemented:

  - Document loading from Supabase storage
  - Deep research analysis of RFP documents
  - Solution sought identification
  - Connection pairs between funder priorities and applicant capabilities
  - Standardized evaluation for all research outputs with HITL integration

- The RFP integration feature is now fully implemented:

  - Document loading with rfpId support
  - Fallback mechanisms for document ID resolution
  - Format-agnostic document processing
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Context-aware chat responses
  - All tests passing

- The authentication middleware has been enhanced:

  - Token refresh handling with expiration detection and calculation
  - Proactive refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration (10-minute threshold)
  - Special handling for expired tokens with refresh_required flag
  - Consistent error response structure for all auth scenarios
  - Resilient edge case handling for missing session data and expiration timestamps
  - Detailed logging for security auditing
  - Comprehensive documentation with client-side integration patterns
  - All tests passing, including edge cases

- **Chat UI Connection**: Refactored to use direct connection to LangGraph (`http://localhost:2024`). Basic message sending and receiving is functional. UI correctly isolated to the chat page.
- **Chat UI Rendering**: Basic message rendering (human and AI) is working correctly after resolving issues with `react-markdown` and conditional rendering logic.

- **Server Architecture**: The backend server now has a clear startup sequence managed by `server.ts`, leveraging a configured Express app from `express-server.ts`. Persistence is handled by `PostgresSaver`.

## Next Steps

1. Test Chat UI thoroughly (tool calls, interrupts, long conversations).
2. Verify message display for all types in the UI.
3. Confirm authentication flow for direct LangGraph connection.
4. Improve error handling in `StreamProvider`.
5. Continue implementation of core `ProposalGenerationGraph` nodes.

## Insights

- Adapter pattern for checkpointing ensures future-proofing against LangGraph API changes
- Robust state management, HITL, and persistence are in place
- Project is on track for backend integration and final polish phases
- Simplifying the chat connection aligns better with LangGraph examples and reduces potential points of failure.

  - `/api/rfp/feedback`, `/resume`, `/interrupt-status`: Refactored to use `threadId` and `OrchestratorService`.
- **Frontend Integration:**
  - `StreamProvider` uses the official LangGraph SDK (`useTypedStream`).
  - Correctly calls `/api/rfp/workflow/init` to get `threadId`.
  - Passes `threadId` to `useTypedStream` for persistent chat sessions.
- **Basic Persistence Tests:**
  - Test 1 (New Thread Init) in `thread-persistence.test.ts` passes.
  - Test 2 (Existing Thread Retrieval) in `thread-persistence.test.ts` passes.

## What's Left to Build / Fix

- **Resolve Test 3 Failure:** Fix the failing test for `addUserMessage` persistence in `thread-persistence.test.ts`. This requires addressing the challenge of verifying state after `graph.invoke` in a unit test context.
- **Implement Test 4:** Write and run the test for thread isolation.
- **Database Schema/RLS Verification (Phase 5.4.6):** Connect to Supabase, confirm `checkpoints` table schema, and configure Row Level Security.
- **End-to-End Testing (Phase 5.4.7):** Manually test the full user flow (new proposal, chat, refresh, resume).
- **Documentation (Phase 5.5):** Update API docs, developer guidelines, UI docs, deployment checklist, performance recommendations.

## Current Status

- Checkpoint refactoring (Phase 5) is nearing completion.
- Backend persistence layer is modernized using `PostgresSaver`.
- Frontend is integrated with the new backend API for thread management.
- **Currently Blocked/Working On:** Resolving the unit testing challenge for state persistence verification in `thread-persistence.test.ts` (Test 3).

## Known Issues

- Unit testing the final persisted state after orchestrator methods like `addUserMessage` is unreliable with the current mocking strategy.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Shifted from custom `SupabaseCheckpointer` to official `PostgresSaver`:** Reduces maintenance and aligns with LangGraph standards.
- **Adopted deterministic `thread_id` pattern:** Simplifies thread lookup and management compared to previous UUID mapping (`ThreadService` is now deprecated).
- **Centralized workflow logic in `OrchestratorService`:** Provides a clear control point for graph interactions.
