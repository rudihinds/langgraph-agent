### Document Parsing System Implementation Complete ✅

**Latest Major Accomplishment: Comprehensive Document Storage & Parsing System**

- **Database Structure Redesign**: Created `proposal_documents` table with proper relationships to `proposals`. Migrated existing data from `metadata.rfp_document` to normalized structure. Established foreign key relationships and referential integrity. Added proper indexing and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

- **Service Layer Implementation**: Built comprehensive `ProposalDocumentService` (backend) for full document management. Created client-side service for Next.js API routes integration. Implemented document parsing, storage, and text extraction capabilities. Added proper error handling, logging, and status tracking. Support for PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats with multi-page capability.

- **Upload Flow Refactoring**: Updated Next.js API route (`/api/proposals/[id]/upload`) to use new service. Refactored upload helper to call new API with simplified interface. Maintained backward compatibility with legacy function. Added proper file validation and storage object tracking. Implemented automatic document record creation on upload.

- **Document Parsing Integration**: Fixed recursive call issue in PDF parser that was causing stack overflow. Successfully tested document parsing with real PDF (56,743 characters extracted). Automatic text storage in both `proposal_documents` and `proposals` tables. Status tracking for parsing operations (`pending`, `success`, `failed`). On-demand parsing with caching for performance.

- **API Endpoints**: Upload endpoint with new service integration and proper auth. Parse document endpoint for on-demand text extraction. Proper authentication, authorization, and error handling. Support for background parsing workflows.

### Phase 1: Backend - Singleton Checkpointer Factory for LangGraph Server

- **Step 1.1: Implement Singleton Checkpointer Factory:** ✅ Completed.
  - Refactored `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` with `getInitializedCheckpointer`.
  - Ensures `PostgresSaver.setup()` is called only once.
  - Corrected TypeScript type error for `pgPoolInstance`.
- **Step 1.2: Utilize Singleton Checkpointer in Graph Compilation:** ✅ Completed.
  - Updated `createProposalGenerationGraph` in `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` to use `getInitializedCheckpointer`.
- **Step 1.3: Verify `langgraph.json` and Server Startup:** ✅ Partially Completed.
  - `langgraph.json` verified to point to `createProposalGenerationGraph`.
  - **User Task:** Manually test LangGraph server startup and check logs.

### Phase 2: Backend - Application Association Layer (Express Server - Port 3001)

- **Step 2.1: Define `user_rfp_proposal_threads` Table:** ✅ Completed.
  - SQL DDL defined and applied via Supabase migration. Table `user_rfp_proposal_threads` created.
- **Step 2.2: Create `ProposalThreadAssociationService**:\*\* ✅ Completed.
  - `apps/backend/services/proposalThreadAssociation.service.ts` created.
  - Service methods `recordNewProposalThread` and `listUserProposalThreads` implemented.
  - Supabase client import updated to use `serverSupabase` (service role client).
- **Step 2.3: Create API Endpoints for Thread Association:** ✅ Completed.
  - Implemented `POST /api/rfp/proposal_threads` (records new thread association; validates input, authenticates user, calls service).
  - Implemented `GET /api/rfp/proposal_threads` (lists user threads; optional rfpId filter; authenticates user, calls service).
  - Endpoints are protected by auth middleware and use Zod for validation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Single State Management**: Confirmed effectiveness of shared `OverallProposalState` with modular intelligence components
- **Master Orchestrator Pattern**: Central RFP analysis with workflow selection proves effective for multi-agent coordination
- **HITL Integration**: Strategic priorities queries provide optimal user collaboration points
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic prompt generation essential for adaptive workflows

### Technical Decisions

- **ES Module Configuration**: `.js` extensions required for TypeScript ES module imports
- **Path Aliases**: @/ aliases improve maintainability over complex relative paths
- **Mock Configuration**: vi.hoisted() essential for proper vitest mock setup
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests validate multi-agent interactions effectively

### Implementation Patterns

- **StateGraph Integration**: Proper node addition and conditional routing patterns established
- **LangGraph Mocking**: importOriginal() preserves actual functionality while mocking specific components
- **Type Safety**: Enum usage alignment between tests and implementation critical for reliability

**Document Management Architecture**: Moved from JSON metadata storage to proper relational database structure with foreign key constraints and normalized data.
**Parsing Strategy**: Implemented cached parsing with on-demand text extraction for optimal performance.
**Multi-page Support**: Confirmed full support for multi-page documents with single text stream extraction for analysis.
Confirmed the necessity of a singleton `PostgresSaver` and its `setup()` being called only once.
Solidified the architecture: frontend generates `app_generated_thread_id`, Express backend records association, LangGraph server uses this ID for its checkpointer.
Identified `serverSupabase` (service role) as the appropriate client for backend database services.
