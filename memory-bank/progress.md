# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is focused on implementing the core nodes of the `ProposalGenerationGraph` for the Proposal Generator Agent.

### Completed

1. **Project Infrastructure**: Set up the monorepo structure, core libraries, and test frameworks.
2. **Core Node Implementations**:
   - ✅ Task 16.1: `documentLoaderNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
   - ✅ Task 16.2: `solutionSoughtNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
   - ✅ Task 16.3: `connectionPairsNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
   - ✅ Task 16.4: `evaluateConnectionsNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Established patterns for node testing
   - Created mocking utilities for LLM responses
   - Implemented both unit and integration tests
4. **Evaluation Framework**:
   - Defined standardized evaluation pattern for all evaluator nodes
   - Created consistent `EvaluationResult` interface with multi-dimensional assessment
   - Implemented human-in-the-loop (HITL) review pattern using interrupts
   - Documented the pattern in `evaluation_pattern_documentation.md`

### Next

1. Implement `sectionManagerNode` (Task 16.5) to organize and manage document sections
2. Update `OverallProposalState` interface to fully support the evaluation pattern
3. Create evaluation criteria configuration files for all content types
4. Continue implementing remaining nodes of the `ProposalGenerationGraph`
5. Prepare for integration testing of the complete graph

## Known Issues

1. The memory bank progress update process occasionally fails to properly update the file.
2. Some tests may be brittle due to complex regex patterns for extracting information from LLM responses.
3. The `OverallProposalState` interface needs updating to fully support the standardized evaluation pattern.
4. Evaluation criteria need to be formalized in configuration files for each content type.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've evolved to a more robust and consistent pattern for error handling across all nodes:

   - Early validation of required inputs
   - Specific classification of different error types
   - Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
   - State updates to reflect error conditions
   - Preservation of raw responses for debugging

2. **TDD Effectiveness**: The Test-Driven Development approach has proven highly effective for implementing complex nodes. Writing comprehensive tests before implementation has helped catch edge cases and ensure robust behavior. This pattern has been successful for all four completed nodes and will continue to be applied.

3. **Response Format Flexibility**: We've implemented a dual-layer parsing approach (JSON primary, regex fallback) for resilient response handling, which has proven valuable for dealing with LLM outputs that may not always perfectly match the expected format.

4. **Standardized Evaluation Pattern**: We've established a comprehensive evaluation framework with the following key elements:

   - **Structured Evaluation Results**: Standardized interface with overall assessment (pass/fail, score) and detailed feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions)
   - **Criteria-Based Assessment**: Evaluation against explicit criteria with individual scoring and feedback
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review using LangGraph interrupts
   - **State Management**: Clear state transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → approved/revised)
   - **Conditional Routing**: Standard pattern for routing based on evaluation results and user feedback

5. **Content Quality Standards**: We've established a consistent quality threshold (score ≥7) for auto-approval of generated content, with clear paths for human review and revision.
