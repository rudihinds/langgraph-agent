## Evolution of Design Decisions

### Checkpointer Implementation

- **Initial Design**: Started with a simple in-memory solution for development
- **Current Design**: Created a modular design with Supabase integration and fallback mechanisms
- **Evolution**: Added error handling, retry logic, and better serialization

### Graph Architecture

- **Initial Design**: Linear flow with limited branching
- **Current Design**: Complex graph with conditional routing and interrupt points
- **Evolution**: Added support for HITL capabilities and better state management

### State Management

- **Initial Design**: Simple state object with minimal tracking
- **Current Design**: Comprehensive state interface with status tracking for all sections
- **Evolution**: Added support for message history, interrupt tracking, and user feedback

### HITL Capabilities

- **Initial Design**: Simple approval mechanism for generated content
- **Current Design**: Comprehensive system with multiple feedback types and interrupt points
- **Evolution**:
  1. Started with basic interrupt concept
  2. Evolved to define clear interrupt points in the graph
