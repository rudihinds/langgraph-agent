# Project Progress - [Date of Update]

## What Works

*   **Core State Definition:** `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts` defines the `ProposalState` interface, required types, helper reducers, and Zod validation schema, aligned with architectural specs (Task #11 completed).
*   **Basic Project Structure:** Assumed to be in place (Task #1 marked done).

## What's Left to Build (High Level - based on Refactoring Plan)

*   **Task #13: Persistence Layer Refinement (In Progress)**
    *   Checkpointer implementation refinement (Current Focus)
    *   Database Schema & Migrations
    *   Row Level Security (RLS)
*   **Task #14: Graph Structure Refinement (In Progress)**
    *   Update Graph Structure & Typing (Subtask In Progress)
    *   Implement Routing Functions
    *   Configure HITL & Orchestrator Integration
*   **Task #12: Orchestrator Service Enhancement (Pending)**
*   **Task #15: Node Implementation (Pending)**
*   **Task #16: Editor Agent Implementation (Pending)**
*   **Task #9: API Layer Enhancement (Pending)**
*   **Task #10: HITL Interaction Implementation (Pending)**
*   **Testing:** Blocked by filesystem access issues. Needs comprehensive implementation once resolved.

## Current Status

*   Completed foundational state management refactoring (Task #11).
*   Starting work on the persistence layer refinement (Task #13).
*   Blocked on creating test files and direct memory bank updates due to filesystem tool restrictions.

## Known Issues & Blockers

*   Persistent TypeScript errors in `ProposalStateAnnotation` definition (using `as any` workaround).
*   Filesystem tool access restrictions preventing test file creation and direct memory bank updates.
*   `task-master next` command cache/logic issue required manual task status updates.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   Decided to use `as any` for `ProposalStateAnnotation` reducers temporarily due to unresolved type errors, relying more heavily on Zod for runtime validation.
*   Attempting terminal commands (`echo > file`) for memory bank updates due to tool limitations.
