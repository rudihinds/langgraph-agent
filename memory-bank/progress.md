# Project Progress

## Current Status (as of 2024-07-26)

The project is currently focused on implementing and verifying the core nodes of the `ProposalGenerationGraph`, following the TDD approach where applicable and ensuring alignment with the defined architecture (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AGENT_BASESPEC.md`).

## What Works

- **Task 16.1: Document Loader Node (`documentLoaderNode`)**: Implementation complete and **unit tests passing**. Retrieves documents from Supabase, handles temporary files, parses content based on MIME type, and updates state. Integration tests are planned.
- **Core Architecture Defined**: `AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENT_BASESPEC.md` provide a solid foundation.
- **State Management (`OverallProposalState`)**: Defined, including necessary fields for research, solution analysis, and section data.
- **Persistence Setup (`SupabaseCheckpointer`)**: Implementation exists, although integration testing is pending.
- **Vitest Testing Setup**: Core configuration is functional, mocking patterns for common scenarios (Node built-ins, ES modules) identified and documented in `activeContext.md`.

## What's Next / To Be Built

1.  **Task 16.2: Requirement Analysis Node (`solutionSoughtNode`)**: Specification created (`spec_16.2.md`). Next steps involve reviewing existing code, writing tests based on the spec, and refining the implementation.
2.  **Task 16.1 Integration Tests**: Implement planned integration tests for `documentLoaderNode`.
3.  **Task 16.3: Evaluation Node (`evaluateSolutionNode`)**: Implement node to evaluate the output of `solutionSoughtNode`, likely involving HITL.
4.  **Remaining Graph Nodes**: Implement `connectionPairsNode`, `evaluateConnectionsNode`, `sectionManagerNode`, section generators, and section evaluators.
5.  **Orchestrator Service**: Develop the core logic for managing sessions, dependencies, and HITL flows.
6.  **Editor Agent Service**: Implement the service responsible for handling revisions.
7.  **API Layer**: Build out API endpoints for UI interaction.
8.  **UI**: Develop the frontend application.

## Known Issues

- **`progress.md` Update Failures**: Previous attempts to update this file via automated edits failed. Monitoring required.
- **Full E2E Flow Untested**: The complete workflow from start to finish, including persistence and HITL, has not been tested.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Architecture Pivot**: Moved to a Hybrid Orchestrated Pattern with a coded Orchestrator Service managing the LangGraph and Editor Agent.
- **Persistence**: Confirmed use of `@langgraph/checkpoint-postgres` (or Supabase equivalent).
- **TDD Emphasis**: Reinforced the value of TDD for developing graph nodes, starting with `documentLoaderNode`.
- **Specification First**: Adopted approach of creating detailed specs (e.g., `spec_16.2.md`) before intensive coding/testing for subsequent nodes.
