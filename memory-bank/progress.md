# Project Progress

## Current Status (as of 2024-07-28)

We are implementing a proposal generation agent system with LangGraph. The current focus is on developing the core components of the `ProposalGenerationGraph`, implemented using a Test-Driven Development approach.

### Project Infrastructure

- âœ… Basic project structure established
- âœ… Core `OverallProposalState` interface defined
- âœ… Error handling patterns established
- âœ… Testing infrastructure set up with Vitest
- âœ… LLM agent integration patterns established

### Core Node Implementations

- âœ… `documentLoaderNode` (Task 16.1) implemented with parsing and extraction
- âœ… `solutionSoughtNode` (Task 16.2) implemented with proper state management
- âœ… `connectionPairsNode` (Task 16.3) implemented with flexible response handling
- ðŸ”„ `evaluateConnectionsNode` (Task 16.4) planning in progress

### Testing Infrastructure

- âœ… Mock implementations for OpenAI and other external dependencies
- âœ… Test fixtures created for sample documents, prompts, and responses
- âœ… Comprehensive test suites covering happy paths and error cases
- âœ… Test helpers for common testing patterns

## What Works

1. **Document Loading & Analysis**: The `documentLoaderNode` successfully parses input documents and extracts key information, handling various formats and error conditions.

2. **Solution Analysis**: The `solutionSoughtNode` effectively analyzes RFP documents to identify the core solution requirements, with graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms for different AI response formats.

3. **Connection Pairs Generation**: The `connectionPairsNode` identifies meaningful connections between the applicant organization's capabilities and the funder's priorities from the RFP, with resilient parsing of both structured and unstructured AI responses.

4. **Test-Driven Development**: Our approach of writing comprehensive test suites before implementation has proven effective in guiding development and ensuring robust functionality.

## What's Next

1. **Task 16.4: Evaluate Connections Node**: Implement the node that evaluates the quality and relevance of connection pairs.

2. **Dependency Resolution**: Create additional nodes for resolving section dependencies.

3. **Graph Integration**: After implementing individual nodes, integrate them into the complete graph with proper edge connections.

4. **Persistence Layer**: Enhance the persistence layer with better error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Known Issues

1. **Progress Document Updates**: Occasionally updates to this progress document fail due to conflicts when multiple edits occur in close succession.

2. **State Naming Consistency**: Some inconsistencies exist between test fixtures and actual state definitions (e.g., `solutionSoughtResults` vs `solutionResults`).

3. **Error Handling in Persistence**: Need enhanced error handling in the persistence layer to better recover from checkpoint failures.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Patterns**: We've established robust error handling patterns across all nodes, with specific handling for different error types (input validation, API errors, timeouts, parsing errors).

2. **Test-Driven Development**: TDD has proven highly effective, particularly for `connectionPairsNode` where comprehensive tests guided the implementation process and ensured all edge cases were covered.

3. **Mock Dependencies**: We've moved to fully mocking all external dependencies (OpenAI, pdf-parse) to prevent test failures related to API rate limiting or filesystem dependencies.

4. **Hybrid Orchestrated Pattern**: We've pivoted to a hybrid pattern where the Orchestrator manages high-level graph execution while individual nodes handle their specific logic.

5. **Specification-First Approach**: For future nodes, we're adopting a specification-first approach where we create detailed specs (like `spec_16.4.md`) before writing tests or implementation.
