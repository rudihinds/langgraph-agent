### Next

1. Implement section generation nodes:
   - `generateProblemStatementNode` (Task 17.2)
   - `generateMethodologyNode` (Task 17.3)
   - `generateBudgetNode` (Task 17.4)
   - `generateTimelineNode` (Task 17.5)
   - `generateConclusionNode` (Task 17.6)
2. Update `OverallProposalState` interface to fully support the evaluation pattern
3. Create evaluation criteria configuration files for all content types
4. Prepare for integration testing of the complete graph

## Known Issues

1. The memory bank progress update process occasionally fails to properly update the file.
2. Some tests may be brittle due to complex regex patterns for extracting information from LLM responses.
3. The `OverallProposalState` interface needs updating to fully support the standardized evaluation pattern.
4. Evaluation criteria need to be formalized in configuration files for each content type.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've evolved to a more robust and consistent pattern for error handling across all nodes:

   - Early validation of required inputs
   - Specific classification of different error types
   - Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
   - State updates to reflect error conditions
   - Preservation of raw responses for debugging

2. **TDD Effectiveness**: The Test-Driven Development approach has proven highly effective for implementing complex nodes. Writing comprehensive tests before implementation has helped catch edge cases and ensure robust behavior. This pattern has been successful for all research nodes and will continue to be applied.

3. **Response Format Flexibility**: We've implemented a dual-layer parsing approach (JSON primary, regex fallback) for resilient response handling, which has proven valuable for dealing with LLM outputs that may not always perfectly match the expected format.

4. **Standardized Evaluation Pattern**: We've established a comprehensive evaluation framework with the following key elements:

   - **Structured Evaluation Results**: Standardized interface with overall assessment (pass/fail, score) and detailed feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions)
   - **Criteria-Based Assessment**: Evaluation against explicit criteria with individual scoring and feedback
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review using LangGraph interrupts
   - **State Management**: Clear state transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → approved/revised)
   - **Conditional Routing**: Standard pattern for routing based on evaluation results and user feedback

5. **Content Quality Standards**: We've established a consistent quality threshold (score ≥7) for auto-approval of generated content, with clear paths for human review and revision.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interruption Pattern**: We've successfully implemented the HITL pattern in all evaluation nodes:

   - Standardized `interruptMetadata` with contextual information about the evaluation
   - Consistent `interruptStatus` field for managing the interruption state
   - Clear integration points for human feedback via the OrchestratorService

7. **Document Loading Strategy**: We've implemented a robust approach for document handling:

   - Fallback chain for document ID resolution (state → environment → default)
   - Format-agnostic document processing (supports PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Comprehensive error handling with actionable messages
   - Consistent state updates to track document status

8. **Authentication and Token Refresh Strategy**: We've implemented a comprehensive approach for authentication:
   - Token validation with detailed error handling for different failure modes
   - Proactive token expiration detection with a 10-minute threshold
   - Token refresh recommendations for tokens nearing expiration
   - Special handling for expired tokens with clear client guidance
   - Standardized error response structure for authentication failures

## Recent Implementation Details

### Enhanced Chat Agent with Document Status Detection

```typescript
// Enhanced document status check with more detailed state detection
let documentStatus = "";
if (state.rfpDocument) {
  switch (state.rfpDocument.status) {
    case "loaded":
      documentStatus =
        "The document has been successfully loaded and is ready for analysis.";
      break;
    case "loading":
      documentStatus =
        "The document is currently being loaded. The user should wait until it completes.";
      break;
    case "error":
      documentStatus = `There was an error loading the document: ${(state.rfpDocument as any).error || "Unknown error"}. The user may need to try again or provide a different document.`;
      break;
    default:
      documentStatus =
        "No document has been loaded yet. The user needs to provide an RFP document ID or upload one.";
  }
} else {
  documentStatus =
    "No document information is available. The user needs to provide an RFP document ID or upload one.";
}

// Include document status in system prompt
const systemPrompt = `You are a helpful assistant for a proposal generation system. 

DOCUMENT STATUS:
${documentStatus}

// Rest of the prompt...
`;
```

### Authentication Middleware with Token Refresh Handling

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates token expiration information and attaches it to the request
 *
 * @param {Object} req - Express request object
 * @param {Object} session - User session containing expiration timestamp
 * @param {Object} logger - Logger instance
 * @param {string} requestId - Request identifier for logging
 * @param {string} userId - User ID for logging
 */
function processTokenExpiration(req, session, logger, requestId, userId) {
  if (!session || !session.expires_at) return;

  const currentTimeSeconds = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  const expiresAtSeconds = session.expires_at;
  const timeRemainingSeconds = expiresAtSeconds - currentTimeSeconds;

  // Attach expiration metadata to request for downstream handlers
  req.tokenExpiresIn = timeRemainingSeconds;
  req.tokenRefreshRecommended =
    timeRemainingSeconds <= TOKEN_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_SECONDS;

  // Log appropriate message based on expiration proximity
  if (req.tokenRefreshRecommended) {
    logger.warn("Token close to expiration", {
      requestId,
      timeRemaining: timeRemainingSeconds,
      expiresAt: expiresAtSeconds,
      userId,
    });
  } else {
    logger.info("Valid authentication", {
      requestId,
      userId,
      tokenExpiresIn: timeRemainingSeconds,
    });
  }
}
```

### Special Handling for Expired Tokens

```javascript
// Special handling for expired tokens
if (error.message && error.message.includes("expired")) {
  logger.warn("Auth error: expired token", { requestId, error });
  return res.status(401).json({
    error: "Token expired",
    message: "Token has expired",
    refresh_required: true,
  });
}
```

### Route Handler Usage Example

```javascript
app.get("/api/data", authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  // If token is close to expiration, suggest a refresh
  if (req.tokenRefreshRecommended) {
    res.set("X-Token-Refresh-Recommended", "true");
  }

  // Proceed with normal request handling
  res.json({ data: "Your data" });
});
```

### Graph Edge for Document Flow

```typescript
// Add edge from DOC_LOADER to CHAT_AGENT to return to chat after document loading
console.log("Adding edge from DOC_LOADER to CHAT_AGENT");
(proposalGenerationGraph as any).addEdge(NODES.DOC_LOADER, NODES.CHAT_AGENT);
```

### Continue API Endpoint

```typescript
/**
 * GET /api/rfp/chat/continue/:proposalId
 *
 * Resume an existing proposal conversation
 *
 * @param {string} proposalId - The ID of the proposal to continue
 * @returns {object} The thread ID and proposal status information
 */
```

### Document Loader Node Implementation

```typescript
/**
 * Document loader node that retrieves and processes RFP documents
 *
 * @param state - The current proposal state
 * @returns Updated state with document information
 */
export async function documentLoaderNode(state: Partial<OverallProposalState>) {
  try {
    // Use rfpId from state, or fallback to env var for testing
    const rfpId =
      state.rfpDocument?.id ||
      state.rfpId ||
      process.env.TEST_RFP_ID ||
      "f3001786-9f37-437e-814e-170c77b9b748";

    // Update state to show loading status
    const updatedState = {
      ...state,
      rfpDocument: {
        ...state.rfpDocument,
        status: LoadingStatus.LOADING,
        id: rfpId,
      },
    };

    // Get document from storage
    const document = await downloadFileWithRetry.invoke({
      bucketName: "proposal-documents",
      path: `${rfpId}/document.pdf`,
    });

    // Process document
    if (document) {
      const parsedDocument = await parseRfpFromBuffer(
        await document.arrayBuffer()
      );

      return {
        ...updatedState,
        rfpDocument: {
          status: LoadingStatus.LOADED,
          id: rfpId,
          text: parsedDocument.text,
          metadata: parsedDocument.metadata,
        },
      };
    }

    // Handle not found case with helpful error
    return {
      ...updatedState,
      rfpDocument: {
        status: LoadingStatus.ERROR,
        id: rfpId,
        metadata: {
          error: "Document not found. Check if document exists in storage.",
          suggestions: [
            "Upload the document again",
            "Verify the document ID is correct",
            "Contact support if the issue persists",
          ],
        },
      },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // Provide helpful error information
    return {
      ...state,
      rfpDocument: {
        status: LoadingStatus.ERROR,
        id: state.rfpDocument?.id || state.rfpId,
        metadata: {
          error: error.message,
          suggestions: [
            "Check if document exists in storage",
            "Verify file format is supported",
            "Try uploading the document again",
          ],
        },
      },
    };
  }
}
```
