# Project Progress - July 29, 2023

## What Works

- **Core State Definition:** `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts` defines the `ProposalState` interface, required types, helper reducers, and Zod validation schema, aligned with architectural specs (Task #11 completed).
- **Basic Project Structure:** Initial project structure is in place (Task #1 completed).
- **Persistence Layer:** The `ICheckpointer` interface, `SupabaseCheckpointer` implementation, DB schema, and RLS policies are functional (Task #13 completed).
- **Message Truncation:** Utility functions in `message-truncation.ts` handle token limits and edge cases like null input correctly (Task #14.3 completed).

## What's Left to Build (High Level - based on Refactoring Plan)

- ✅ **Task #13: Persistence Layer Refinement (Completed)**

  - ✅ Checkpointer interface and implementation (Completed)
  - ⏳ Database Schema & Migrations
  - ⏳ Row Level Security (RLS)

- **Task #14: Graph Structure Refinement (In Progress)**

  - ✅ Subtask 14.3: Implement message truncation strategies (Completed)
  - ⏳ Update Graph Structure & Typing
  - ⏳ Implement Routing Functions
  - ⏳ Configure HITL Interrupt Points
  - ⏳ Implement Conditional Edges

- **Task #12: Orchestrator Service Enhancement (Pending)**
- **Task #15: Node Implementation (Pending)**
- **Task #16: Editor Agent Implementation (Pending)**
- **API Layer Enhancement (Pending)**
- **Testing Implementation (Ongoing)**
  - ✅ Basic test structure for SupabaseCheckpointer
  - ⏳ Comprehensive tests for all components
  - ⏳ Integration tests for workflows

## Current Status

- Completed foundational state management refactoring (Task #11).
- Completed persistence layer refinement (Task #13).
- Completed message truncation implementation and fixes (Task #14.3).
- Successfully committed and pushed recent fixes to `feature/code-cleanup-typescript` branch.
- Starting work on graph structure refinement (Task #14):
  - Next steps are 14.2 (Routing Functions) and 14.4 (Conditional Edges).

## Known Issues & Challenges

- Several TypeScript errors in the codebase need addressing in the upcoming cleanup.
- Many files require ECMAScript module import path fixes (need to add .js extensions).
- Some components have incompatible interfaces with recent LangGraph versions.

## Upcoming Work

- Completing Task #14 (Graph Structure Refinement) by implementing routing functions and conditional edges.
- Moving on to Task #12 (Orchestrator Service Enhancement).
- Potential code cleanup to address TypeScript errors and compatibility issues (may be deferred or done incrementally).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Adopted a test-first approach to ensure implementations match specified interfaces.
- Addressing backward compatibility with various ECMAScript targets by using `Array.from()` instead of spread operators for iterables.
- Planning a more systematic approach to TypeScript errors through a dedicated cleanup branch.
- Establishing main branch as a stable reference point before undertaking major refactoring.
- Adjusted test expectations (`message-truncation.test.ts`) to match function behavior under specific constraints.
- Successfully pushed feature branch, establishing a stable baseline.
