# Project Progress

## Current Status

The project is focused on implementing the core nodes of the `ProposalGenerationGraph` for the Proposal Generator Agent.

### Completed

1. **Project Infrastructure**: Set up the monorepo structure, core libraries, and test frameworks.
2. **Core Node Implementations**:
   - ✅ **Research Phase**:
     - ✅ Task 16.1: `documentLoaderNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
     - ✅ Task 16.2: `researchNode` - Successfully implemented with proper error handling
     - ✅ Task 16.3: `solutionSoughtNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
     - ✅ Task 16.4: `connectionPairsNode` - Successfully implemented with comprehensive tests
     - ✅ Task 16.5: `evaluateResearchNode` - Successfully implemented with HITL integration
     - ✅ Task 16.6: `evaluateSolutionNode` - Successfully implemented with HITL integration
     - ✅ Task 16.7: `evaluateConnectionsNode` - Successfully implemented with HITL integration
3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Established patterns for node testing
   - Created mocking utilities for LLM responses
   - Implemented both unit and integration tests
4. **Evaluation Framework**:
   - Defined standardized evaluation pattern for all evaluator nodes
   - Created consistent `EvaluationResult` interface with multi-dimensional assessment
   - Implemented human-in-the-loop (HITL) review pattern using interrupts
   - Documented the pattern in `evaluation_pattern_documentation.md`

### Next

1. Implement `sectionManagerNode` (Task 17.1) to organize and manage document sections
2. Implement section generation nodes:
   - `generateProblemStatementNode` (Task 17.2)
   - `generateMethodologyNode` (Task 17.3)
   - `generateBudgetNode` (Task 17.4)
   - `generateTimelineNode` (Task 17.5)
   - `generateConclusionNode` (Task 17.6)
3. Update `OverallProposalState` interface to fully support the evaluation pattern
4. Create evaluation criteria configuration files for all content types
5. Prepare for integration testing of the complete graph

## Known Issues

1. The memory bank progress update process occasionally fails to properly update the file.
2. Some tests may be brittle due to complex regex patterns for extracting information from LLM responses.
3. The `OverallProposalState` interface needs updating to fully support the standardized evaluation pattern.
4. Evaluation criteria need to be formalized in configuration files for each content type.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: We've evolved to a more robust and consistent pattern for error handling across all nodes:

   - Early validation of required inputs
   - Specific classification of different error types
   - Custom error messages with node-specific prefixes
   - State updates to reflect error conditions
   - Preservation of raw responses for debugging

2. **TDD Effectiveness**: The Test-Driven Development approach has proven highly effective for implementing complex nodes. Writing comprehensive tests before implementation has helped catch edge cases and ensure robust behavior. This pattern has been successful for all research nodes and will continue to be applied.

3. **Response Format Flexibility**: We've implemented a dual-layer parsing approach (JSON primary, regex fallback) for resilient response handling, which has proven valuable for dealing with LLM outputs that may not always perfectly match the expected format.

4. **Standardized Evaluation Pattern**: We've established a comprehensive evaluation framework with the following key elements:

   - **Structured Evaluation Results**: Standardized interface with overall assessment (pass/fail, score) and detailed feedback (strengths, weaknesses, suggestions)
   - **Criteria-Based Assessment**: Evaluation against explicit criteria with individual scoring and feedback
   - **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**: Consistent approach to pausing execution for human review using LangGraph interrupts
   - **State Management**: Clear state transitions (queued → running → evaluating → awaiting_review → approved/revised)
   - **Conditional Routing**: Standard pattern for routing based on evaluation results and user feedback

5. **Content Quality Standards**: We've established a consistent quality threshold (score ≥7) for auto-approval of generated content, with clear paths for human review and revision.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interruption Pattern**: We've successfully implemented the HITL pattern in all evaluation nodes:
   - Standardized `interruptMetadata` with contextual information about the evaluation
   - Consistent `interruptStatus` field for managing the interruption state
   - Clear integration points for human feedback via the OrchestratorService

## Completed Tasks

- Fixed the Logger implementation in DependencyService.ts

  - Updated the import from `{ logger }` to `{ Logger }`
  - Added proper logger instance creation with `Logger.getInstance()`
  - Added proper error handling for unknown errors
  - All tests are now passing

- Implemented Dependency Chain Management

  - Verified dependencies.json configuration file already exists
  - Fixed and tested DependencyService implementation
  - Verified OrchestratorService implementation of dependency-related methods
  - Enabled and verified all dependency management unit tests

- Completed Research Phase Implementation
  - Implemented and tested all research-related nodes, including document loading, research, solution analysis, connection pairs, and evaluation nodes
  - Integrated HITL pattern for human review of research results
  - Established consistent error handling and state management patterns across all nodes

## Current Status

- The dependency chain management system is now working correctly:

  - When a section is edited, dependent sections are automatically marked as stale
  - Users can choose to keep the stale sections as-is or regenerate them
  - The regeneration process can include guidance for improvement
  - The system tracks which sections depend on others via a configuration file

- The research phase nodes are now fully implemented:
  - Document loading from Supabase storage
  - Deep research analysis of RFP documents
  - Solution sought identification
  - Connection pairs between funder priorities and applicant capabilities
  - Standardized evaluation for all research outputs with HITL integration

## Next Steps

- Implement Section Generation Phase:

  - Develop `sectionManagerNode` to coordinate section generation
  - Implement individual section generation nodes
  - Integrate evaluation nodes for each section
  - Create section-specific evaluation criteria

- Complete Checkpoint Integration & Interrupt Handling
  - Create Supabase Checkpointer
  - Standardize interrupt metadata
  - Enhance Orchestrator's resume logic

## Known Issues

- Section generation nodes need to be implemented according to the established patterns
- Evaluation criteria for sections need to be defined
- Graph routing logic needs to be updated to support the complete workflow

_This document should be updated whenever significant progress is made on the project._

## Known Issues

- Error handling for the connection pairs generation has edge cases
- The evaluation criteria for specific sections need refinement
- Need to ensure consistent styling across all generated sections

## Project Evolution

The architecture has evolved to use a more structured approach with dedicated node files for better maintainability and testing. We've moved from having all node implementations in the nodes.js file to having dedicated files in the /nodes directory. This provides clearer separation of concerns and enables better unit testing.

The state management has been refined to better handle section generation and dependencies between sections. The section manager now uses a topological sort to ensure that sections are generated in the correct order based on their dependencies.

The prompt structure has been improved to provide more context to the LLM for better results, including strict output format validation using Zod schemas.
