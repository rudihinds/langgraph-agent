# Project Progress Tracking

**Last Modified**: August 21, 2023

## What Works

- **Checkpointer Implementation**:

  - Created an `ICheckpointer` interface with key operations (put, get, list, delete)
  - Implemented an in-memory checkpointer for testing/development
  - Implemented a Supabase-based checkpointer for persistent storage
  - Added adapter pattern for LangGraph integration
  - Added multi-tenant isolation via user IDs
  - Robust error handling and retries for database operations
  - Created test scripts to validate checkpointer behavior

- **State Management**:

  - Defined comprehensive `ProposalState` structure in `state/proposal.state.ts`
  - Added custom reducers for immutable state updates (`sectionsReducer`, `errorsReducer`)
  - Documented state structure with JSDoc comments
  - Set up well-defined status management for various proposal components

- **Environment Configuration**:

  - Standardized environment variable loading across the application
  - Centralized env config loading from root `.env` file
  - Graceful fallbacks for development environments

- **Database Schema**:

  - Created checkpoint table design with row-level security
  - Designed session table for tracking active proposals
  - Implemented schema migrations in Supabase

- **Conditionals Implementation**:

  - Implemented comprehensive conditional routing functions in `conditionals.ts`
  - Added detailed logging for all routing decisions
  - Covered all required routing paths (research, solution, sections)
  - Added handling for stale content regeneration
  - Created complete test suite for all conditionals

- **Graph Structure**:
  - Designed full StateGraph with all required nodes and edges
  - Connected nodes properly with conditional routing
  - Implemented state channels with appropriate reducers
  - Added factory functions for graph creation with checkpointer integration

## What's Next

- **Implement remaining node functions**:

  - Complete the LLM-based implementations for research generation
  - Add solution evaluation with scoring
  - Implement section generation with proper templates
  - Add the full finalization logic

- **Enhance Human-in-the-Loop workflow**:

  - Complete UI integration for review interfaces
  - Implement real-time feedback mechanism
  - Add email notifications for review requests

- **API Endpoints**:

  - Create Express routes for graph interaction
  - Implement proper error handling and validation
  - Add authentication middleware
  - Add streaming support for real-time updates

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Connect UI components to the backend API
  - Add real-time status updates
  - Implement section editor interface
  - Create review dashboards

## Known Issues

- Current graph type definitions have compatibility issues with LangGraph API
- Need consistent typing between ProposalState interface and LangGraph state definition
- Some node implementations are stubs and need proper LLM integration
- Need to ensure proper error propagation throughout the graph
- Edge routing needs thorough testing with real data

## Evolution of Design Decisions

- **Checkpointer Implementation**:

  - Started with a basic in-memory implementation
  - Added Supabase integration for persistence
  - Evolved to use adapter pattern for flexibility
  - Added isolation by user ID for multi-tenant support
  - Enhanced with comprehensive error handling and retries

- **Graph Architecture**:

  - Initial design had limited routing logic
  - Evolved to comprehensive conditional routing
  - Added support for stale content regeneration
  - Enhanced with proper state tracking
  - Moved to dedicated conditionals file for better organization
  - Added proper test coverage for routing logic

- **State Management**:
  - Started with basic field definitions
  - Evolved to comprehensive schema with validation
  - Added custom reducers for complex state updates
  - Enhanced with proper status tracking for all components
  - Improved typing and documentation
