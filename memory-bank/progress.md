# Project Progress

This document tracks the overall progress of the proposal agent development.

_Last updated: July 30, 2023_

## What Works

- **State Management**: The `OverallProposalState` interface is defined with appropriate fields and the state reducers for message and section updates are implemented.

- **Checkpointer Implementation**: The checkpointer adapter pattern is fully implemented with both in-memory and Supabase storage options.

  - `ICheckpointer` interface that defines the storage contract
  - `InMemoryCheckpointer` implementation for local development/testing
  - `SupabaseCheckpointer` implementation for production use
  - Adapter classes to bridge our storage implementations with LangGraph's `BaseCheckpointSaver`
  - Factory function that provides appropriate fallbacks based on environment configuration
  - Test script to verify all checkpointer operations

- **Environment Configuration**: Root `.env` setup is working correctly for both development and production environments.

- **Database Schema**: SQL schema for the checkpoints table is designed and documented.

## What's Next

1. **LangGraph Integration**: Complete the proposal agent graph structure and node implementations.

2. **Node Functions**: Implement the core agent node functions:

   - Research generation for RFP analysis
   - Section planning based on dependencies
   - Content generation with proper LLM prompting
   - Evaluation against quality criteria
   - Human feedback integration

3. **Conditional Routing**: Implement routing functions for HITL decision points and error recovery.

4. **API Development**: Develop the RESTful endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

5. **Testing**: Develop comprehensive testing infrastructure:

   - Unit tests for individual node functions
   - Integration tests for graph execution
   - End-to-end tests for full proposal generation

6. **Documentation**: Update technical documentation to reflect implementation details.

## Known Issues

- **Type Consistency**: We need to ensure consistent typing between the `ProposalState` interface and the LangGraph state definition.

- **Environment Handling**: Need to standardize environment variable loading across all parts of the application.

## Evolution of Design Decisions

### Checkpointer Implementation (July 30, 2023)

After evaluating different approaches to LangGraph persistence with Supabase, we decided to:

1. **Create an adapter pattern** to separate storage concerns from LangGraph interface requirements.
2. **Support multiple storage backends** including in-memory for development and testing.
3. **Provide graceful fallbacks** when database credentials are missing or invalid.
4. **Ensure multi-tenant isolation** by including userId in storage operations.

This approach provides flexibility, testability, and robustness while ensuring we can evolve our storage layer independently from LangGraph's interface requirements.

### State Management (July 27, 2023)

The initial state design was reviewed and refined to:

1. **Add proper section status tracking** with enumerated status values.
2. **Include dependency mapping** to manage the order of section generation.
3. **Add timestamp tracking** for monitoring generation time and detecting stalled processes.
4. **Include error tracking** at both the global and section-specific level.

This provides a more comprehensive foundation for the proposal generation workflow and better tracking of the generation process.

### Development Approach (July 25, 2023)

We opted for a "test-first" approach to ensure robustness:

1. **Start with interfaces** to clearly define contracts.
2. **Implement minimal functionality first** to establish the core workflow.
3. **Add tests before expanding functionality** to ensure stability as we progress.
4. **Focus on critical path components first** (state management, persistence, core generation).
