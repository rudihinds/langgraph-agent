## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Single State Management**: Confirmed effectiveness of shared `OverallProposalState` with modular intelligence components
- **Master Orchestrator Pattern**: Central RFP analysis with workflow selection proves effective for multi-agent coordination
- **Dual-Tool Strategy**: Enhanced Research demonstrates effectiveness of combining web search with deep research synthesis
- **HITL Integration**: Strategic priorities queries provide optimal user collaboration points
- **Template Variables**: Dynamic prompt generation essential for adaptive workflows
- **Complete Collaboration Systems**: Demonstrated critical importance of action systems alongside input processing

### Technical Decisions

- **ES Module Configuration**: `.js` extensions required for TypeScript ES module imports
- **Path Aliases**: @/ aliases improve maintainability over complex relative paths
- **Mock Configuration**: vi.hoisted() essential for proper vitest mock setup
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests validate multi-agent interactions effectively
- **Funder Name Extraction**: Multi-pattern regex approach proves effective for organization identification
- **Validation Loop Design**: Must handle both original and refined query types for complete collaboration

### Implementation Patterns

- **StateGraph Integration**: Proper node addition and conditional routing patterns established
- **LangGraph Mocking**: importOriginal() preserves actual functionality while mocking specific components
- **Type Safety**: Enum usage alignment between tests and implementation critical for reliability
- **Structured Intelligence**: Metadata tracking essential for comprehensive research validation
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Input processing + intelligent action + validation loop = complete system
- **Iterative Refinement**: Track refinement cycles with limits while enabling meaningful collaboration

**Document Management Architecture**: Moved from JSON metadata storage to proper relational database structure with foreign key constraints and normalized data.
**Parsing Strategy**: Implemented cached parsing with on-demand text extraction for optimal performance.
**Multi-page Support**: Confirmed full support for multi-page documents with single text stream extraction for analysis.
Confirmed the necessity of a singleton `PostgresSaver` and its `setup()` being called only once.
Solidified the architecture: frontend generates `app_generated_thread_id`, Express backend records association, LangGraph server uses this ID for its checkpointer.
Identified `serverSupabase` (service role) as the appropriate client for backend database services.
