# LangGraph Compliant Status Implementation Test Plan

## What We Fixed

### Backend Changes ✅
1. **Removed JSON.stringify from all config.writer calls**
   - `intelligence-search.ts`: Now sends plain objects `{ message: "..." }`
   - `research-agent.ts`: Fixed 4 instances
   - `intelligence-formatter.ts`: Fixed 1 instance
   - `parallel-dispatcher.ts`: Fixed 4 instances
   - `linguistic-patterns.ts`: Fixed 1 instance
   - `synthesis.ts`: Fixed 1 instance

### Frontend Changes ✅
1. **Created `useStreamWithStatus` hook**
   - Automatically adds "custom" to streamMode
   - Handles LangGraph's correct event format: `["custom", data]`
   - Manages status state and auto-clearing
   - Preserves existing onChunk handlers

2. **Simplified Thread component**
   - Uses the new hook instead of complex inline logic
   - Removed manual status state management
   - Cleaner, more maintainable code
   - Simple status display with loading spinner

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Intelligence Gathering
```bash
npm run dev
```
1. Create a new proposal
2. Upload an RFP document
3. During intelligence gathering, you should see:
   - Status messages like "Analyzing intelligence requirements for [Company]..."
   - "Planning research strategy..."
   - "Planning X targeted searches..."
   - "Looking into company initiatives..." (from search tool)
   - Messages appear with spinner icon
   - Auto-clear after 5 seconds

### 2. Test RFP Analysis
1. When RFP analysis starts, you should see:
   - "Initializing RFP analysis..."
   - "Analyzing [complexity] RFP document ([X] words)..."
   - "Identifying organization and industry context..."
   - "Dispatching to specialized analysis agents..."
   - "Analyzing linguistic patterns..." (from individual agents)
   - "Synthesizing analysis results..."

### 3. Verify Console Output
Look for these console logs:
- `[useStreamWithStatus] Received status: [message]`
- No JSON parsing errors
- No "Failed to parse custom event" warnings

### 4. Check Network Tab
In browser DevTools Network tab:
- Look at the EventSource stream
- Custom events should show as: `["custom", { message: "..." }]`
- No JSON strings being sent

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- Backend sent: `JSON.stringify({ type: "...", message: "...", timestamp: "..." })`
- Frontend expected wrong structure
- Status messages might not appear or cause errors

### After Fix:
- Backend sends: `{ message: "..." }`
- Frontend correctly handles: `["custom", { message: "..." }]`
- Status messages appear reliably with auto-clear

## Key Pattern
This implementation is now 100% LangGraph compliant:
- `config.writer` receives plain objects (not JSON strings)
- Frontend handles the documented event structure
- Clean separation of concerns with reusable hook
