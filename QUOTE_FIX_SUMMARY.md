# Import Statement Quote Fix Summary

## Issue

During the refactoring of the codebase to a feature-based structure, import statements were created with mismatched quotes, causing syntax errors. The issue appeared in multiple files as:

```
import { Card } from '@/features/ui/components/card";
                    ^                             ^
                 single quote                double quote
```

These mismatched quotes were causing TypeScript errors and breaking the build process.

## Solution

Three scripts were created to address this issue:

1. **`fix-specific-files.js`** - Targeted script to fix known problematic files
2. **`fix-mismatched-quotes.js`** - More general script to find and fix all files with the issue
3. **`fix-import-quotes.js`** - Comprehensive script with fallback options for edge cases

### Execution Results

- The specific file fix addressed 2 files with known issues: `DashboardSkeleton.tsx` and `DashboardFilters.tsx`
- The comprehensive scan discovered and fixed 33 additional files with similar issues
- All import statements were standardized to use double quotes consistently

### Example Fix

**Before (with syntax error):**

```
import { Card } from '@/features/ui/components/card";
```

**After (fixed):**

```
import { Card } from "@/features/ui/components/card";
```

## Fixed Files

In total, 35 files were updated across the codebase, including:

- UI components
- Dashboard components
- Auth components
- Layout components
- Proposal components
- Hooks
- Type definitions

## Pattern Used

The scripts used regular expressions to identify and fix mismatched quotes:

```javascript
// Pattern 1: from '@/path" -> from "@/path"
const pattern1 = /from\s+'([^']+)"/g;
let fixed = content.replace(pattern1, 'from "$1"');

// Pattern 2: from "@/path' -> from "@/path"
const pattern2 = /from\s+"([^"]+)'/g;
fixed = fixed.replace(pattern2, 'from "$1"');
```

## Future Prevention

To prevent this issue from occurring again:

1. Configure linter rules to enforce consistent quote styles in import statements
2. Consider using Prettier with specific configuration for imports
3. Add this check to pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines to catch mismatched quotes early
