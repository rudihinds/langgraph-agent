# Loop Prevention Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Analysis & Setup
- [x] State History Implementation
  - [x] Add a stateHistory array to the orchestrator state model
  - [x] Implement state fingerprinting function that creates hashable representations of relevant state portions
  - [x] Create utility functions to compare states and detect cycles
- [x] Configure Recursion Limits
  - [x] Add explicit recursionLimit configuration to the orchestrator graph
  - [x] Implement error handling for GraphRecursionError to provide meaningful feedback

## Phase 2: Core Prevention Mechanisms
- [x] Implement Clear Termination Conditions
  - [x] Audit all conditional edges to ensure they have proper termination paths to END node
  - [x] Add explicit completion criteria in the state model
  - [x] Update edge conditions to properly evaluate completion states
- [x] Create Maximum Iterations Counter
  - [x] Add per-node iteration tracking in the state
  - [x] Implement threshold detection with appropriate error handling
  - [x] Add logging for iteration tracking
- [x] Add Progress Detection
  - [x] Implement state comparison to detect when the workflow isn't making meaningful progress
  - [x] Add "no progress" counter that triggers termination after N iterations without state changes
  - [x] Create configurable thresholds for progress detection sensitivity

## Phase 3: Node-Level Safety
- [x] Create Safety Wrapper HOC
  - [x] Implement withSafetyChecks higher-order component to wrap node functions
  - [x] Add checks for maximum iterations, runtime, and progress
  - [x] Implement timeout detection and enforcement
- [x] Add Cycle Detection Node
  - [x] Create a specialized node that analyzes state history to detect cyclic patterns
  - [x] Implement similarity detection for "almost identical" states
  - [x] Configure the node to run after each orchestrator iteration

## Phase 4: Timeout & Cancellation
- [ ] Implement Timeout Safeguards
  - [ ] Add overall workflow timeout using LangGraph's cancellation mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement per-node execution time limits
  - [ ] Create graceful termination procedures for timeout scenarios
- [ ] Add Cancellation Support
  - [ ] Configure cancellation tokens for workflow interruption
  - [ ] Implement cleanup procedures for terminated workflows
  - [ ] Add event logging for cancellation events

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation
- [x] Implement Test Scenarios (Partial)
  - [x] Create test cases for workflows that previously caused infinite loops
  - [ ] Test all termination conditions and timeout scenarios
  - [ ] Verify resource cleanup during both normal and forced termination

## Next Steps

Our next priorities should be:

1. **Complete timeout safeguards implementation:**
   - Implement workflow timeout mechanisms
   - Add per-node execution time limits
   - Create graceful termination procedures

2. **Implement cancellation support:**
   - Configure cancellation tokens
   - Add cleanup procedures for terminated workflows
   - Implement event logging for cancellations

3. **Finalize testing and validation:**
   - Complete testing for all termination conditions
   - Verify resource cleanup during both normal and forced termination
   - Add integration tests with real workflows

4. **Documentation and examples:**
   - Create additional usage examples
   - Document best practices for timeout configuration
   - Add troubleshooting guides for common issues
