# Agent System Architecture - Two-Phase Intelligent Proposal Generation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the advanced multi-agent backend system designed to assist users in analyzing Request for Proposals (RFPs) and generating sophisticated, strategically-positioned proposal content. The system implements a **two-phase approach**: a **Planning Phase** with 11 specialized intelligence-gathering agents, followed by a **Writing Phase** with 8 adaptive content generation agents.

The system leverages **LangGraph.js** for managing complex stateful workflows, incorporates comprehensive **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** checkpoints for collaborative refinement, includes automated evaluation and validation steps, and supports strategic exploration with checkpointing. Key capabilities include seamless pause/resume, user intelligence integration, parallel processing with Send API, competitive positioning, and adaptive workflow selection.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

- **Two-Phase Intelligence:** Planning phase gathers comprehensive strategic intelligence before writing begins
- **Stateful & Persistent:** Full pause/resume capabilities via persistent checkpointer with comprehensive state management
- **Collaborative Intelligence:** User knowledge integration throughout both phases with strategic feedback loops
- **Adaptive Workflow:** Dynamic agent selection and approach modification based on RFP complexity and user preferences
- **Parallel Processing:** Send API enables efficient concurrent processing of independent tasks
- **Strategic Positioning:** Competitive intelligence and positioning strategy drives all content generation
- **Interruptible (HITL):** Strategic user collaboration checkpoints with intelligent guidance and options
- **Evaluated & Validated:** Multi-layer quality assurance with requirement coverage analysis
- **Dependency Aware:** Sophisticated dependency tracking with guided regeneration and gap resolution
- **Orchestrated:** Central service coordinates workflow, state management, and agent coordination
