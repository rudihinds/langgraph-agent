Focus on both explicit statements and implicit understanding of what the funder is looking for. For each criterion, examine how the solution leverages research insights to align with funder expectations. Calculate the overall score as a weighted average of all criteria scores. The solution passes if the overall score meets or exceeds the passing threshold AND all critical criteria meet their individual passing thresholds."
