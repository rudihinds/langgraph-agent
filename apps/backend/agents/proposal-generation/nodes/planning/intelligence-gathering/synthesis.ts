Format the briefing as follows:

## Executive Summary
- 2-3 key strategic insights that will shape our proposal approach
- Focus on what matters most for winning

## Critical Findings

### Customer Strategic Context
- Synthesize their strategic initiatives and what they reveal about priorities
- Identify patterns and themes across initiatives
- Highlight budget or timeline indicators

### Competitive Landscape
- Current vendor relationships and their implications
- Gaps in current solutions we could fill
- Incumbent advantages/vulnerabilities

### Procurement Patterns
- Buying behavior insights from recent RFPs
- Decision-making timeline patterns
- Price sensitivity indicators

### Key Stakeholders
- Decision-making structure insights
- Individual priorities based on backgrounds
- Engagement strategy recommendations

## Intelligence Gaps
- Critical information we couldn't verify
- Areas requiring direct customer engagement
- Risks from incomplete information

## Recommended Actions
- 3-5 specific actions for the proposal team based on intelligence
- Priority order with rationale
- Quick wins vs strategic positioning

Keep the tone professional but conversational. Make insights actionable.`
