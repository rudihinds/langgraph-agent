 * Intelligence Gathering Integration Tests
 * Tests for the complete intelligence gathering workflow integration

 * TODO: These tests need to be rewritten to match the new ReAct pattern architecture:
 * - Test researchAgent with ToolNode pattern
 * - Test intelligenceFormatter instead of synthesis
 * - Test the new routing logic in intelligenceGatheringRouter
 * - Remove references to deleted intelligenceAgent and synthesis nodes
