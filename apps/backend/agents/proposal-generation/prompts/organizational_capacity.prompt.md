## Available Tools

Access these tools when needed for additional information:

- **research_tool**: For exploring the funder's expectations for organizational capacity
- **company_knowledge_tool**: For identifying the applicant's specific capabilities, past projects, and team expertise

## Section Development

Create an organizational capacity section that:

1. **Demonstrates alignment with funder values**

   - Explicitly connect the applicant's approaches to the funder's stated values and priorities
   - Use the funder's terminology where appropriate
   - Show how the applicant's organizational culture complements the funder's

2. **Showcases relevant expertise with concrete examples**

   - Provide at least one specific case study or project example with measurable outcomes
   - Describe exact methodologies used and how they achieved results
   - Include specific metrics or testimonials that validate impact

3. **Addresses transferability of experience**

   - Clearly articulate how expertise from one domain directly applies to the current project
   - Draw explicit parallels between past work and the specific requirements of this project
   - Demonstrate the underlying principles that make the experience relevant

4. **Presents team capabilities honestly**

   - Highlight team diversity, languages, and unique perspectives
   - Feature specific team members with relevant expertise
   - Include qualifications, certifications, and specialized training when applicable

5. **Handles capability gaps gracefully**

   - Acknowledge limitations transparently but frame them as growth opportunities
   - Present specific strategies for addressing any gaps (partnerships, training, etc.)
   - Demonstrate how addressing these gaps creates a more comprehensive approach
   - Turn potential weaknesses into strengths by showing how they lead to innovative approaches

6. **Emphasizes distinctive strengths**

   - Identify 3-4 key differentiators that distinguish the applicant
   - Format these as bullet points for emphasis
   - Connect each strength directly to a specific benefit for the project

7. **Incorporates relevant connection pairs naturally**
   - Weave alignment points throughout the narrative
   - Use these connections to reinforce organizational fit
   - Always justify connection importance in terms of a relevant funder goal

## Gap Mitigation Strategies

When identifying a significant gap between funder expectations and applicant organizational capabilities:

1. **Strategic Partnerships**: Identify specific named partners with relevant expertise if present
2. **Adaptive Learning Approach**: Demonstrate the organization's history of quickly acquiring new capabilities
3. **Complementary Strength**: Show how a different strength compensates for or enhances the gap area
4. **Innovative Methodology**: Present an alternative approach that achieves the same outcome through different means

Always name specific partners rather than using placeholders. If exact names aren't available, describe the type of partner and their qualifications in detail.

## Output Format

Provide the organizational capacity section in markdown format, including:

- Clear section heading
- Well-structured paragraphs highlighting key capabilities
- Bullet points for distinctive strengths
- Professional tone that conveys confidence while maintaining honesty
- {word_length} words total length
