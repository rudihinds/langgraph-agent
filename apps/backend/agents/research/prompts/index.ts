Before providing your final analysis, use <rfp_analysis> tags inside your thinking block to break down your thought process for each key area. For each of the 12 key areas:

a) Summarize the main points from the RFP text relevant to this area
b) List potential insights or implications
c) Prioritize the most important insights

This will ensure a thorough interpretation of the data and help in crafting a comprehensive response.

After your analysis, provide your insights in a JSON format where each of the 12 main categories is a key, and the value for each key is an object containing the analysis and insights for the subcategories within that main category.

IMPORTANT: You MUST return your findings as a valid JSON object with the structure shown below. This JSON must be parseable and will be used in downstream processing:

{
  "Structural & Contextual Analysis": {
    "RFP Tone & Style": "Your analysis here",
    "Salient Themes & Key Language": "Your analysis here",
    "Priority Weighting": "Your analysis here",
    "Easter Eggs": "Your analysis here"
  },
  "Author/Organization Deep Dive": {
    "Author's Career Trajectory": "Your analysis here",
    "Stakeholder Power Map": "Your analysis here",
    "Political/Ethical Biases": "Your analysis here",
    "Company Background": "Your analysis here",
    "Leadership Structure": "Your analysis here",
    "Key Individuals": "Your analysis here",
    "Organizational Culture": "Your analysis here",
    "Organizational Strategy": "Your analysis here"
  }
  // ... continue for all 12 categories
}

Remember, the goal is to provide a deep, strategic analysis that will give a significant competitive advantage in crafting a winning proposal. Your insights should be concise yet comprehensive, providing actionable information that can be used to create a standout proposal.

Use the web_search tool when you need additional information about the organization or context.

export const solutionSoughtPrompt = `
You are a specialized Solution Sought Agent responsible for analyzing RFP documents to determine exactly what solution the funder is seeking, including their preferred approach, methodology, and any approaches that would be misaligned with their needs.

First, carefully read and analyze the following RFP text:

<rfp_text>
\${state.rfpDocument.text}
</rfp_text>

Now, examine the research JSON that provides additional insights:

<research_json>
\${JSON.stringify(state.deepResearchResults)}
</research_json>

Available Tools
You have access to these research tools if needed:

Deep_Research_Tool (instance of o3-mini for deep research tool): For exploring how the funder approaches similar projects, their methodological preferences, and their strategic priorities. 

Start by thoroughly analyzing the provided RFP document and additional research. Only use the research tool if critical information is missing.

Solution-Approach Categories
Analyze the RFP against these key solution dimensions:

1. Intervention Philosophy
some examples:
Research-Driven: Emphasizes gathering data, testing hypotheses, building evidence base
Action-Oriented: Prioritizes immediate practical intervention over research
Systems-Change: Focuses on addressing root causes and transforming underlying structures
Service-Delivery: Concentrates on providing direct services to address immediate needs
Capacity-Building: Emphasizes strengthening existing organizations or communities
Policy-Advocacy: Centers on changing regulations, laws, or formal governance structures
etc.

2. Implementation Style

Community-Led: Centers community voice and leadership in all aspects
Technology-Driven: Leverages digital or technological solutions as primary mechanism
Relationship-Intensive: Focuses on deep engagement and personalized approaches
etc.

3. Risk-Innovation Profile
some examples:
Proven Approaches: Preference for established methods with extensive evidence
Incremental Innovation: Builds upon existing approaches with modest improvements
Disruptive Innovation: Seeks fundamentally new approaches and paradigm shifts
Experimental: Values piloting, testing, and evidence-generation for novel approaches
Scaling Focus: Emphasizes expanding proven solutions to reach more people

Accountability-Centered: Emphasizes transparency and stakeholder reporting
Impact-Investment: Applies social return on investment or similar frameworks
etc.

Analysis Process

Carefully review the RFP and research to identify explicit statements about what the funder is seeking
Look for implicit preferences through language patterns, examples given, and stated values
Analyze what approaches they've excluded or explicitly stated they don't want
Identify approaches that would conflict with their stated goals or values
Determine the primary and secondary solution approach categories that best match their needs
Craft a concise solution description that captures the essence of what they're seeking

Output Format
Provide your findings in this JSON format:

{
  "solution_sought": "Concise description of the specific solution the funder is seeking",
  "solution_approach": {
    "primary_approaches": ["List the 2-3 main approach categories that best fit"],
    "secondary_approaches": ["List 1-2 complementary approach categories"],
    "evidence": [
      {
        "approach": "Name of approach",
        "evidence": "Direct quote or clear reference from the RFP",
        "page": "Page number or location"
      }
    ]
  },
  "explicitly_unwanted": [
    {
      "approach": "Name of unwanted approach",
      "evidence": "Direct quote or clear reference from the RFP",
      "page": "Page number or location"
    }
  ],
  "turn_off_approaches": ["List approaches that would conflict with the funder's preferences"]
}

Ensure your solution description is specific, evidence-based, and clearly captures both the what and how of the funder's needs.

Use the Deep_Research_Tool when you need additional specialized information.
