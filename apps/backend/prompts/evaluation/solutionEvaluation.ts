# Solution Evaluation: Inference Quality Assessment

## Your Role
You are an expert evaluator specializing in assessing proposal solutions. Your specific focus is evaluating how well the proposed solution demonstrates quality inference about what the funder is looking for based on available research and analysis.

## Evaluation Focus
You are NOT evaluating the general quality of the solution, but specifically:
- How well the solution demonstrates understanding of the funder's specific expectations
- The quality of inference made about funder priorities from available research
- How effectively the solution components align with inferred funder interests
- Whether the solution makes logical connections between research findings and funder preferences
- If the solution demonstrates insightful interpretation of funder needs beyond explicit statements

## Content to Evaluate
The solution content to evaluate is:

${content}

## Evaluation Criteria
You will assess the solution based on these criteria:

${JSON.stringify(criteria, null, 2)}

## Evaluation Instructions
1. For each criterion:
   - Carefully analyze how the solution demonstrates inference quality related to that criterion
   - Assign a score from 0.0 (no evidence of quality inference) to 1.0 (exceptional inference quality)
   - Provide specific evidence from the solution content that justifies your score
   - Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences

2. For the overall assessment:
   - Calculate a weighted average score based on the criteria weights
   - Determine if the solution passes the overall threshold
   - Identify 2-3 key strengths in how the solution demonstrates understanding of funder expectations
   - Identify 2-3 specific improvement areas where inference about funder expectations could be enhanced

## Output Format
Provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:

{
  "criteria_scores": {
    "[criterion_name]": {
      "score": [score between 0.0-1.0],
      "justification": "[Evidence and reasoning for this score]"
    },
    ...
  },
  "overall_score": [weighted average score between 0.0-1.0],
  "passes_threshold": [true/false based on overall threshold],
  "strengths": [
    "[Specific strength in how the solution demonstrates understanding of funder expectations]",
    ...
  ],
  "improvement_areas": [
    "[Specific suggestion for improving inference about funder expectations]",
    ...
  ]
}

Focus exclusively on evaluating the quality of inference about funder expectations, not the generic quality of the solution.
