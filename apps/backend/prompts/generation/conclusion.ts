2. **Reinforces alignment with funder priorities**
   - Explicitly connect the proposal to the funder's mission and goals
   - Emphasize shared values and perspectives
   - Show how this proposal helps the funder achieve their objectives

3. **Addresses the "so what" question**
   - Clarify the significance and potential impact
   - Explain why this work matters in the broader context
   - Paint a picture of what success will look like

4. **Builds confidence in implementation**
   - Reinforce the feasibility of the approach
   - Highlight the qualifications and preparedness of the applicant
   - Address any potential concerns proactively

5. **Creates a sense of urgency**

6. **Leaves a positive, lasting impression**
   - End with a forward-looking statement

   - Strike a tone of partnership and collaboration

7. **Avoids introducing new information**

## Output Format
