# Checkpoint Refactor - Progress Report

**Overall Goal:** Ensure reliable, persistent checkpointing with the latest LangGraph.js version and Supabase, and resolve critical graph execution errors that block testing.

---

## Phase 1: Resolve Core Graph Execution and Connectivity Blockers (Complete)

**Goal:** Fix critical errors preventing checkpointer testing and establish a working connection with Supabase using the official `PostgresSaver`.

### ✅ Step 1.1: Fix Tool Call Sequencing Error (`BadRequestError`)

- **Status:** Resolved/Not Reproducible
- **Issue:** Original plan mentioned an OpenAI `BadRequestError`.
- **Action:** Tested tool calling flow; logs confirm correct message sequence.
- **Conclusion:** Core tool call mechanism appears functional.

### ✅ Step 1.2: Diagnose and Fix `PostgresSaver` Connection Issue

- **Status:** Done
- **Issue:** `PostgresSaver` connection timeout.
- **Root Cause:** Using incorrect Supabase hostname ("Direct connection" `db.*`) instead of the required "Session pooler" hostname (`aws-*-*.pooler.supabase.com`) for port 5432.
- **Solution:** Updated environment variables (`SUPABASE_DB_HOST`, `SUPABASE_DB_USER`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`) to use Session Pooler details. Direct `psql` connection now successful.

### ◻️ Step 1.3: Improve `interpretIntentTool` Reliability

- **Status:** New
- **Issue:** Logs show `interpretIntentTool` consistently returns `command: "other"` even for clear requests like loading a document. This prevents the graph from routing to state-altering nodes (e.g., `documentLoaderNode`), hindering persistence testing and core functionality.
- **Action (Based on LangChain.js Docs):**
  1.  **Refine Tool Schema:** Review and enhance the Zod schema (`CommandSchemaType`) in `apps/backend/tools/interpretIntentTool.ts`. Ensure it includes all target commands (`load_document`, etc.) and uses clear `.describe()` statements for fields.
  2.  **Refine Tool Description:** Update the main `description` of `interpretIntentTool` to clearly state its purpose and expected command outputs.
  3.  **Verify Tool Binding:** Confirm the updated tool is correctly passed to `.bindTools()` in `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/chatAgent.ts`.
  4.  **(Optional) Enhance System Prompt:** Consider adding examples to the system prompt in `chatAgentNode` to better guide the LLM in using the `interpretIntentTool` correctly.
  5.  **Test:** Send clear commands (e.g., "Load document: [text]") and verify the tool returns the correct structured command (e.g., `{"command": "load_document", ...}`).
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/tools/interpretIntentTool.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/chatAgent.ts`.

### ◻️ Step 1.4: Verify `PostgresSaver` End-to-End Persistence

- **Status:** Blocked (by Step 1.3) / Needs Verification
- **Pre-requisites:** Step 1.3 (Improve `interpretIntentTool`) must allow routing to state-altering nodes.
- **Issue:** User reports `checkpoints` table in Supabase remains empty despite successful `PostgresSaver.setup()` calls. This indicates the final `put` operation might be failing or not occurring correctly.
- **Action:**
  1.  After Step 1.3 is complete, trigger a flow that modifies significant state (e.g., loading a document via `documentLoaderNode`).
  2.  Verify data is written to the configured Supabase checkpoint table (`ENV.CHECKPOINTER_TABLE_NAME`).
  3.  Test resuming a conversation with the same `thread_id` to ensure the modified state (e.g., the loaded document) is correctly retrieved from the checkpoint.
  4.  Investigate `PostgresSaver.put()` call context and potential silent failures if data still doesn't appear in the table.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` (ensure checkpointer is used correctly during compilation and invocation), Supabase table schema.

### ◻️ Step 1.5: Stabilize with Official `MemorySaver` for Development/Fallback

- **Status:** Done (Fallback mechanism confirmed working in logs)
- **Pre-requisite:** N/A (Was dependent on Tool Call error, which seems resolved).
- **Action:** The `robust-checkpointer.ts` correctly falls back to `MemorySaver` when `PostgresSaver` fails. Behavior (persistence within session, lost on restart) confirmed.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`.

## Phase 2: Fix Core Build Errors & Align Checkpointers with LangGraph 0.2.x API

**Goal:** Get the backend to build successfully by addressing the most critical TypeScript errors, focusing first on the checkpointer implementation to match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface.

### ◻️ Step 2.1: Fix `pg` Namespace Error in `robust-checkpointer.ts`

- **Status:** Pending
- **Issue:** Build error `Cannot find namespace 'pg'` in `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`, despite `pg` being installed and added to `apps/backend/package.json`.
- **Action:**
  1. Ensure `import pg from 'pg';` or `import * as pg from 'pg';` exists at the top of `robust-checkpointer.ts`.
  2. Verify `pg` and `@types/pg` are correctly listed in `apps/backend/package.json` dependencies/devDependencies.
  3. Run `npm install` again within `apps/backend` and potentially the root.
  4. Check `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` for any settings that might prevent type resolution (though current settings seem okay).
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`, `apps/backend/package.json`

### ◻️ Step 2.2: Refactor `SupabaseCheckpointer` to Correctly Implement `BaseCheckpointSaver`

- **Status:** Pending (Previous attempt resulted in type errors)
- **Issue:** Build errors indicate `SupabaseCheckpointer` doesn't correctly match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface from `@langchain/langgraph`. Errors include missing methods (`putWrites`, `getNextVersion`), incorrect method signatures (`put`), and potential issues with type imports (`CheckpointMetadata`, etc.).
- **Action:**
  1. **Research:** Use Context7 and Brave Search for specific examples of implementing `BaseCheckpointSaver` (especially `getTuple`, `list`, `put`) with `@langchain/langgraph@^0.2.0`. Look for the exact type definitions and expected method signatures.
  2. **Refactor:** Modify `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts`:
     - Ensure it correctly extends `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
     - Implement required methods (`getTuple`, `list`, `put`) with the **exact signatures** expected by the interface in the current LangGraph version. Pay close attention to parameter types (`RunnableConfig`, `Checkpoint`, `CheckpointMetadata`, `CheckpointListOptions`) and return types.
     - Correctly handle the `serde` property (likely inherited or passed via `super`).
     - Adjust internal logic (fetching/saving data) to fit these method signatures.
     - Update imports, potentially trying `@langchain/langgraph/checkpoints` if types aren't found directly in `@langchain/langgraph`.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts`

### ◻️ Step 2.3: Fix `checkpointer-factory.ts` Type Errors

- **Status:** Pending
- **Issue:** Linter error `Type 'SupabaseCheckpointer' is missing the following properties...` indicates the factory is returning an object that doesn't satisfy the `BaseCheckpointSaver` type hint, likely due to the errors in `SupabaseCheckpointer` itself.
- **Action:**
  1. This should resolve automatically once Step 2.2 is complete and `SupabaseCheckpointer` correctly implements `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
  2. Ensure all imports for removed checkpointers (`InMemoryCheckpointer`, `LangGraphCheckpointer`, etc.) are cleaned up.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts`

---

## Phase 3: Address Remaining Build Errors and Runtime Issues

**Goal:** Fix remaining TypeScript errors and resolve runtime issues identified in previous logs (tool execution, state updates).

### ◻️ Step 3.1: Resolve Remaining TypeScript Build Errors

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2)
- **Issue:** Numerous remaining TS errors related to LangChain/LangGraph core types, LLM client wrappers, loop prevention, etc.
- **Action:** Once Phase 2 is complete and the checkpointer builds cleanly, systematically address the remaining errors reported by `npm run build`. Prioritize errors in core graph logic (`graph.ts`, `nodes.ts`, `chatAgent.ts`, `toolProcessor.ts`). Use Context7/Brave Search for updated API usage patterns in LangChain/LangGraph 0.2.x.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** Multiple files across `apps/backend`.

### ◻️ Step 3.2: Fix `interpretIntentTool` Invocation & Argument Parsing

- **Status:** Done (Tool call structure corrected in Step 1.3 refactor)
- **Issue:** Logs showed `interpret_intent` was called with empty arguments (`args: {}`).
- **Solution:** Refactored `interpretIntentTool.ts` to use Zod schema for input and simplified the tool's internal logic. The LLM now correctly generates structured arguments. Verified in logs that `toolArgs` in `toolProcessor.ts` now contain the expected structured data (`{"command":"load_document","request_details":"99"}`).

### ◻️ Step 3.3: Fix `documentLoaderNode` Logic

- **Status:** Done (Error resolved, but underlying issue potentially masked by build errors)
- **Issue:** `documentLoaderNode` failed with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'storage')`. This was initially masked by incorrect error logging. The root cause was traced back to `SUPABASE_URL` being incorrectly set to the _pooled_ connection string in the environment, preventing the standard Supabase client from initializing correctly. The node logic itself was also updated to correctly source the `rfpId` from `state.intent.request_details`.
- **Solution:** Corrected environment variable guidance (use direct URL for `SUPABASE_URL`). Updated `documentLoaderNode` to check `state.intent.request_details`. Fixed `UserIntent` type definition. Added detailed error logging.
- **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/document_loader.ts`, `apps/backend/state/modules/types.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/chatAgent.ts`, `.env.local` (manual update needed by user).

---

## Phase 4: Verify End-to-End Functionality

**Goal:** Ensure the agent completes workflows correctly, persists state, and handles errors gracefully.

### ◻️ Step 4.1: Full Workflow Test with Persistence

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 & 3)
- **Action:** Once build errors are resolved and the agent runs without immediate crashes, perform an end-to-end test:
  1. Start a new conversation.
  2. Load a document (e.g., "load document 99").
  3. Verify the `documentLoaderNode` completes successfully and updates the state.
  4. Check the `checkpoints` table in Supabase for a new/updated entry for the conversation's `thread_id`.
  5. Stop and restart the backend server.
  6. Attempt to resume the conversation (using the same `thread_id` via frontend or API call).
  7. Verify the loaded document state is restored.

### ◻️ Step 4.2: Review Loop Prevention Logic (Postponed)

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 & 3)
- **Issue:** Loop prevention logic (`loop-prevention.ts`, `state-fingerprinting.ts`, etc.) was likely affected by LangGraph API changes (`setRecursionLimit`, hooks).
- **Action:** After the core graph and persistence are working, revisit the loop prevention implementation. Update it according to LangGraph 0.2.x best practices (potentially using built-in mechanisms or adapting the custom logic).

### ◻️ Step 4.3: Final Cleanup and Refinement

- **Status:** Blocked
- **Action:** Remove temporary logging, refine error handling, update documentation (`README.md`, `PLANNING.md`, `checkpoint-refactor.md`).
