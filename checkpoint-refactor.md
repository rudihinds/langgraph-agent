## Phase 1: Resolve Core Graph Execution and Connectivity Blockers

**Goal:** Fix critical errors preventing checkpointer testing and establish a working connection with Supabase using the official `PostgresSaver`.

### ✅ Step 1.1: Fix Tool Call Sequencing Error (`BadRequestError`)

- **Status:** Resolved/Not Reproducible
- **Issue:** Original plan mentioned an OpenAI `BadRequestError`.
- **Action:** Tested tool calling flow; logs confirm correct message sequence.
- **Conclusion:** Core tool call mechanism appears functional.

### ✅ Step 1.2: Diagnose and Fix `PostgresSaver` Connection Issue

- **Status:** Done
- **Issue:** `PostgresSaver` connection timeout.
- **Root Cause:** Using incorrect Supabase hostname ("Direct connection" `db.*`) instead of the required "Session pooler" hostname (`aws-*-*.pooler.supabase.com`) for port 5432.
- **Solution:** Updated environment variables (`SUPABASE_DB_HOST`, `SUPABASE_DB_USER`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`) to use Session Pooler details. Direct `psql` connection now successful.

### ✅ Step 1.3: Improve `interpretIntentTool` Reliability

- **Status:** Done (Tool call structure corrected, `documentLoaderNode` updated to use intent)
- **Issue:** `interpretIntentTool` returned `command: "other"`; `documentLoaderNode` didn't use intent.
- **Action:** Refined tool schema with `.describe()`, updated tool description, simplified tool logic. Updated `documentLoaderNode` to use `state.intent.request_details`. Corrected `UserIntent` type.
- **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/tools/interpretIntentTool.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/chatAgent.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/document_loader.ts`, `apps/backend/state/modules/types.ts`.

### ◻️ Step 1.4: Verify `PostgresSaver` End-to-End Persistence (and `SupabaseCheckpointer`)

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 - Build Errors & Checkpointer Implementation)
- **Pre-requisites:** Phase 2 completion.
- **Issue:** User reports `checkpoints` table in Supabase remains empty.
- **Action:**
  1.  After Phase 2 is complete and build errors are resolved, trigger a flow that modifies state.
  2.  Verify data is written to the Supabase checkpoint table.
  3.  Test resuming a conversation.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts`.

---

## Phase 2: Fix Core Build Errors & Align Checkpointers with LangGraph 0.2.x API

**Goal:** Get the backend to build successfully by addressing the most critical TypeScript errors, focusing first on the checkpointer implementation to match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface.

### ✅ Step 2.1: Fix `pg` Namespace Error in `robust-checkpointer.ts`

- **Status:** Done
- **Issue:** Build error `Cannot find namespace 'pg'` or type errors with `pg.Pool`.
- **Action:**
  1. Ensured `import * as pg from 'pg';` exists.
  2. Corrected type annotation for `pool` variable to `InstanceType<typeof PgPoolClass>`.
  3. Verified `pg` and `@types/pg` are in `apps/backend/package.json`.
- **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`.

### ⚠️ Step 2.2: Refactor `SupabaseCheckpointer` to Correctly Implement `BaseCheckpointSaver` (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Issue:** Build errors in `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts` indicate it doesn't correctly match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface from `@langchain/langgraph`. Key errors include:
  - Missing/incorrect type imports (e.g., `SerializerProtocol`, `JsonPlusSerializer`, `PendingWrite`, `CheckpointListOptions`). Import path `@langchain/langgraph/checkpoint` was incorrect.
  - Class `SupabaseCheckpointer` does not implement inherited abstract member `getTuple`.
  - Property `serde` potentially overwriting base property.
  - Method signature mismatches for `list`, `putWrites`, and `getNextVersion`.
  - `parent_config` vs `parentConfig` in `CheckpointTuple` (likely a typo in our code).
- **Action:**
  1.  **Strictly Adhere to `BaseCheckpointSaver` Interface:** Consult official LangGraph.js documentation for `BaseCheckpointSaver` (v0.2.x) for exact method signatures (`get`, `getTuple`, `list`, `put` (or `putWrites` if that's what the interface demands), `getNextVersion`) and properties (`serde`).
  2.  **Correct Imports:** Ensure all types (`Checkpoint`, `CheckpointMetadata`, `CheckpointTuple`, `RunnableConfig`, etc.) are imported from their correct LangGraph/LangChain modules (likely `@langchain/langgraph` or `@langchain/core/runnables`).
  3.  **Implement Missing Methods:** Add `getTuple` with the correct signature.
  4.  **Correct Method Signatures:** Modify `list`, `putWrites` (or ensure `put` is primary if `putWrites` is an internal detail of some savers), and `getNextVersion` to precisely match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface definitions regarding parameters and return types.
  5.  **`serde` Handling:** Ensure `this.serde` is initialized correctly via `super({ serde: options.serde ?? new JsonPlusSerializer() })` if `JsonPlusSerializer` is the correct default and is correctly imported.
  6.  **Resolve Supabase Client Type Errors:** Ensure `this.client.from(this.tableName)` calls are compatible with the Supabase client typing, particularly if generic type arguments are needed for `from<T>`.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts`

### ◻️ Step 2.3: Fix `checkpointer-factory.ts` Type Errors

- **Status:** Pending (Dependent on Step 2.2)
- **Issue:** Linter error `Type 'SupabaseCheckpointer' is missing the following properties...` and `Cannot find module '../../agents/logger.js'`.
- **Action:**
  1.  The primary type error should resolve automatically once Step 2.2 is complete and `SupabaseCheckpointer` correctly implements `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
  2.  Fix the import path for `logger.js`.
  3.  Ensure the factory logic for instantiating `SupabaseCheckpointer` aligns with its updated constructor and options.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts`

---

## Phase 3: Address Remaining Build Errors and Runtime Issues

**Goal:** Fix remaining TypeScript errors and resolve runtime issues identified in previous logs (tool execution, state updates).

### ◻️ Step 3.1: Resolve Remaining TypeScript Build Errors (Postponed)

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2)
- **Issue:** Numerous remaining TS errors related to LangChain/LangGraph core types, LLM client wrappers, loop prevention, etc.
- **Action:** Once Phase 2 is complete and the checkpointer builds cleanly, systematically address the remaining errors reported by `npm run build`. Prioritize errors in core graph logic (`graph.ts`, `nodes.ts`, `chatAgent.ts`, `toolProcessor.ts`). Use Context7/Brave Search for updated API usage patterns in LangChain/LangGraph 0.2.x.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** Multiple files across `apps/backend`.

---

## Phase 4: Verify End-to-End Functionality (Postponed)

**Goal:** Ensure the agent completes workflows correctly, persists state, and handles errors gracefully.

### ◻️ Step 4.1: Full Workflow Test with Persistence

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 & 3)

### ◻️ Step 4.2: Review Loop Prevention Logic

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 & 3)

### ◻️ Step 4.3: Final Cleanup and Refinement

- **Status:** Blocked

---

## Phase 5: Consolidate to `PostgresSaver` and Streamline Persistence (Opinionated Refactor)

**Core Principle:** Consolidate around the official `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`'s `PostgresSaver` for interacting with the Supabase database. Custom logic for associating checkpoints with users and proposals/RFPs will be handled by constructing a well-defined `thread_id` _before_ interacting with the checkpointer.

**Affected Files (Summary):**

- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` (Becomes primary factory)
- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts` (To be deleted)
- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts` (To be refactored or removed)
- `apps/backend/services/checkpointer.service.ts` (To be refactored)
- `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` (Graph instantiation to be updated)
- Any service layer/API handler that initiates graph flows (Needs to construct `thread_id`)

---

### Sub-Phase 5.1: Consolidate to `PostgresSaver` and Simplify Persistence Layer

1.  **✅ Elevate `robust-checkpointer.ts` as the Primary Source for `PostgresSaver` Instances:**

    - **Status:** Done (Verified `await checkpointer.setup()` is correctly placed. Corrected `pg.Pool` type to `InstanceType<typeof PgPoolClass>`)
    - **Action:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` already correctly attempts to instantiate `PostgresSaver` (for Supabase) and falls back to `MemorySaver`. This will be our main factory for DB-backed checkpointers.
    - **Justification:** Leverages the official, maintained LangGraph component for Postgres, ensuring closer adherence to `BaseCheckpointSaver` and reducing custom maintenance. The fallback logic is already in place. (Ref: [PostgresSaver Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/checkpoint_postgres.PostgresSaver.html#setup))
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`

2.  **✅ Deprecate and Remove Custom `SupabaseCheckpointer.ts`:**

    - **Status:** Done
    - **Action:** Delete the file `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts`.
    - **Justification:** Its functionality is fully covered by `PostgresSaver` when connected to Supabase. Removing it reduces custom code, potential bugs, and the burden of keeping it aligned with `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts` (deletion)

3.  **✅ Refactor or Remove `checkpointer-factory.ts`:**

    - **Status:** Done (Removed `checkpointer-factory.ts`)
    - **Action:**
      - **Option A (Preferred for Simplicity):** Remove `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts` entirely if its only purpose was to choose between `MemorySaver` and `SupabaseCheckpointer`. `robust-checkpointer.ts` now handles the robust choice between `PostgresSaver` (for Supabase) and `MemorySaver`.
      - **Option B (If retaining for other reasons):** If `checkpointer-factory.ts` serves other purposes, modify `createCheckpointer` so if `options.type` is `"supabase"` or `"robust"`, it asynchronously calls and returns `createRobustCheckpointer(options)` from `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`. This implies `createCheckpointer` in the factory would become `async`.
    - **Justification:** Simplifies the checkpointer creation pathway. `robust-checkpointer.ts` is now the main entry point for obtaining a production-ready checkpointer.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts` (deletion)

4.  **✅ Streamline `services/checkpointer.service.ts`:**
    - **Status:** Done (Refactored to use `createRobustCheckpointer`, removed `userIdGetter`/`proposalIdGetter`, and fixed linter error by removing `req` param and related imports)
    - **Action:**
      - Refactor `createCheckpointer` in `apps/backend/services/checkpointer.service.ts`. Its primary role should now be to directly call `createRobustCheckpointer` from `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`.
      - The logic for `userIdGetter` and `proposalIdGetter` will be _removed_ from this service and from any checkpointer configuration. This information will be encoded into the `thread_id` by the calling service (see Sub-Phase 5.2).
      - The `componentName` parameter might still be useful for logging or if different robust configurations are needed per component in the future, but not for `thread_id` construction at this level.
    - **Justification:** Simplifies the service's responsibility. The `robust-checkpointer.ts` handles the actual instantiation. Contextual identifiers belong in the `thread_id`, managed by the workflow-initiating service.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/services/checkpointer.service.ts`

---

### Sub-Phase 5.2: Standardize API Entry, Thread Management, and Orchestration

**Core Principle:** Establish a single, clear API endpoint for initiating/resuming proposal workflows, managed by the `OrchestratorService`, which handles `thread_id` construction and checkpointer interaction.

1.  **Consolidate API Entry Points:**

    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
    - **Action:**
      - **Designate Express Server as Sole API Server:** Confirm `apps/backend/api/express-server.ts` as the single source for backend API routes.
      - **Review & Deprecate `apps/backend/index.ts`:** Analyze `apps/backend/index.ts` for any unique, critical logic not present in the Express app. Plan for its deprecation and eventual deletion.
      - **Update `package.json` Scripts:** Modify scripts (e.g., `start`, `dev`, `start:api`) to exclusively use `express-server.ts` for launching the API.
    - **Justification:** Eliminates redundancy, clarifies the API surface for frontend and external clients, and aligns with standard backend practices.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/express-server.ts`, `apps/backend/index.ts` (for review/deletion), `package.json`.

2.  **Create Centralized Workflow Initialization Endpoint:**

    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
    - **Action:**
      - **New Handler File:** Create `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`.
      - **Define Route:** Implement an Express `POST` route `/api/rfp/workflow/init` within `workflow.ts`.
        - This handler will expect `userId` (from auth middleware, assumed available in `req.user.id` or similar) and `rfpId` (from request body).
        - It can also accept initial RFP data (e.g., text, file information) if a new workflow is being started.
      - **Mount Router:** Mount this new workflow handler in `apps/backend/api/rfp/index.ts`.
    - **Justification:** Provides a dedicated and clear API for clients (e.g., the frontend) to start or resume a proposal generation workflow.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` (new), `apps/backend/api/rfp/index.ts`.

3.  **Implement Orchestrator-Driven Thread Management & Workflow Initiation:**

    - **Status:** ✅ In Progress (startProposalGeneration refactored)
    - **Action:**
      1.  ✅ **API Handler Refactor (`apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`):**
          - The API handler in `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` has been refactored.
          - It no longer accepts or processes `initialRfpData` from the request body.
          - Workflow initialization now strictly relies on `userId` (from auth) and `rfpId`.
          - When a new workflow is identified (`workflowContext.isNew === true`), the handler now calls `orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration(workflowContext.threadId, userId, rfpId)`.
      2.  Obtain an instance of `OrchestratorService` (e.g., via `await getOrchestrator()`). This is done within the API handler.
      3.  The API handler calls `await orchestratorService.initOrGetProposalWorkflow(userId, rfpId)`.
          - This orchestrator method uses `constructProposalThreadId(userId, rfpId)` (from `../../lib/utils/threads.js`).
          - It calls `this.checkpointer.getTuple({ configurable: { thread_id: constructedThreadId } })`.
          - It returns `{ threadId, initialState: Checkpoint | null, isNew: boolean }`.
      4.  **If `isNew: true` (within API Handler):**
          - ✅ **OrchestratorService.startProposalGeneration Refactored:**
            - **Signature Update:** The method now accepts the correct signature: `(threadId: string, userId: string, rfpId: string)`.
            - **Removed `initialRfpData`:** No longer expects or uses `initialRfpData`.
            - **Fixed State Structure:** Removed redundant `rfpId` property from state and renamed `updatedAt` to `lastUpdatedAt` to match interface.
            - **Initial Graph Input:** Constructs proper initial state for the LangGraph graph through a system task message.
            - **Triggering `documentLoaderNode`:**
              - Sets initial state with `rfpDocument.id = rfpId` and triggers document loading via initial message: `System Task: Load RFP document with ID ${rfpId}`.
              - The `chatAgentNode` processes this initial message and the `interpretIntentTool` should parse this into a document load command.
            - Invokes the graph with this initial state/message and the `threadId` in `RunnableConfig`.
          - The API handler then returns the `threadId` and the initial (or first step) state to the client.
      5.  **If `isNew: false` (within API Handler):**
          - The API handler returns the existing `threadId` and `initialState` (the latest checkpoint) to the client, allowing the frontend to resume.
    - **Justification:** `OrchestratorService` centrally manages workflow/thread lifecycle and interaction with the checkpointer, driven by a deterministic `thread_id`. The API handler coordinates these calls.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` (refactored), `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts` (next to refactor), `apps/backend/lib/utils/threads.ts`.

4.  **Standardize Chat Interactions (`/api/rfp/chat`):**
    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending (Endpoint and orchestrator methods exist but need to align with the new `threadId` flow from `/api/rfp/workflow/init`).
    - **Action:**
      - Ensure the client (frontend) obtains the `threadId` from the `/api/rfp/workflow/init` response and sends it with every chat message to `/api/rfp/chat`.
      - The `apps/backend/api/rfp/chat.ts` handler will receive `threadId` and `message`.
      - It will call `await orchestratorService.processChatMessage(threadId, message)` (or `addUserMessage` then `invoke`).
      - The orchestrator uses this `threadId` in `RunnableConfig` for graph invocation.
    - **Justification:** All ongoing interactions for a specific proposal workflow consistently use the established `thread_id`.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/chat.ts`, `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts`.

### Sub-Phase 5.3: System-Wide Code Review, Cleanup, and Verification

1.  **Update Graph Instantiation in `graph.ts` for Dynamic Checkpointing:**

    - **Status:** ✅ Done
    - **File(s) Modified:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts`
    - **Change Overview:**
      - Removed `userId` and `proposalId` parameters from `createProposalGenerationGraph` function
      - The checkpointer is now created without binding it to any specific thread
      - Added comments clarifying that thread_id will be provided at invocation time via RunnableConfig
      - This allows the same compiled graph to be reused across different threads
    - **Original Code:**

    ```typescript
    async function createProposalGenerationGraph(
      userId: string = ENV.TEST_USER_ID,
      proposalId?: string
    ) {
      const checkpointer = await createRobustCheckpointer({
        // Pass necessary options if robust checkpointer expects them, e.g., threadId
        // For now, assuming it doesn't require specific options beyond environment checks
        // userId, // Not directly needed by robust-checkpointer factory itself
        // proposalId, // Not directly needed by robust-checkpointer factory itself
      });
      // ...
    }
    ```

    - **New Code:**

    ```typescript
    async function createProposalGenerationGraph() {
      const checkpointer = await createRobustCheckpointer();

      // ...

      // The thread_id will be provided at invocation time via RunnableConfig
      // This allows the same compiled graph to be reused across different threads
      const compiledGraph = proposalGenerationGraph.compile({
        checkpointer,
      });

      return compiledGraph;
    }
    ```

2.  **✅ Verify Environment Variables for `PostgresSaver`:**

    - **Status:** Done (as part of Phase 1.2)
    - **Action:** Double-check that `DATABASE_URL` (or individual `

3.  **Resolve Linter Error in `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`:**

    - **Status:** ✅ Done
    - **Issue:** The call to `orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration` in `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` had an argument mismatch ("Expected 3 arguments, but got 4.").
    - **Action:** Upon inspection of the workflow.ts file, we found the call to startProposalGeneration already correctly passes the three required arguments (threadId, userId, rfpId) and does not include initialRfpData:

    ```javascript
    const { state: newWorkflowState } =
      await orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration(
        workflowContext.threadId,
        userId,
        rfpId
        // initialRfpData is already removed
      );
    ```

    The code comments also indicate this was already adjusted as part of the refactoring process. Any lingering linter errors may be due to the TypeScript compiler not picking up the updated method signature in orchestrator.service.ts, which should resolve after a rebuild.

    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` (verified)

4.  **Review and Align Other API Handlers for Consistent OrchestratorService Usage:**

    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
    - **Goal:** Ensure all API endpoints consistently use the `OrchestratorService` for any graph interaction or state modification and correctly use the `thread_id` obtained via the `/workflow/init` flow (or passed by the client).
    - **Files to Review & Refactor:**
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/feedback.ts`
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/resume.ts`
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/interrupt-status.ts`
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/thread.ts` (for any routes other than a potential `/init` which is now superseded)
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/express-handlers/start.ts` (and its usage in `apps/backend/api/rfp/index.ts` - likely to be deprecated/removed in favor of `/workflow/init`).
    - **Action for each handler:** Verify it:
      - Obtains the `threadId` (likely from the request body or parameters, originally sourced from `/workflow/init`).
      - Calls appropriate methods on the `OrchestratorService` (e.g., `processFeedback`, `resumeWorkflow`, `getInterruptStatus`).
      - Does _not_ interact directly with the checkpointer or generate its own `thread_id`.
    - **Justification:** Standardizes interaction patterns and ensures the `OrchestratorService` remains the central point of control for graph workflows.

5.  **Confirm `RunnableConfig` Usage in `OrchestratorService`:**
    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
    - **Goal:** Ensure all LangGraph invocations (`invoke`, `stream`, `updateState`, etc.) within the `OrchestratorService` correctly pass the `thread_id` within the `RunnableConfig.configurable` object.
    - **Action:** Review methods in `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts` that call the compiled graph.
    - **Justification:** Critical for correct, isolated state persistence per workflow.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts`.

### Sub-Phase 5.4: Frontend Integration and Thread Persistence Testing

**Goal:** Integrate the frontend chat UI with our refactored backend to enable thread persistence and comprehensive testing of the end-to-end flow.

1. **Update StreamProvider Configuration for LangGraph SDK Integration:**

   - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
   - **File(s) to Modify:** `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx`
   - **Action:**
     1. Fix type errors in `useTypedStream` initialization:
        ```typescript
        const streamValue = useTypedStream({
          apiUrl: directApiUrl || "http://localhost:2024", // Default LangGraph server port
          assistantId: assistantId || "proposal-generation", // Standardize on correct agent ID
          streamMode: "values",
          threadId: threadId || undefined, // Pass custom threadId from our API
        });
        ```
     2. Ensure proper error handling for initialization failures
     3. Add comprehensive logging at key points in the thread initialization flow
   - **Justification:** Eliminates type errors and aligns with LangGraph SDK expectations. Using the correct `assistantId` ensures proper agent targeting, while the fallback values improve robustness.

2. **Standardize on the Official SDK Implementation:**

   - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
   - **File(s) to Modify:**
     - `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx` (update)
     - `apps/web/src/features/chat/components/providers/Stream.tsx` (remove/deprecate)
   - **Action:**
     1. Update all components to use the `StreamProvider.tsx` with `@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react`
     2. Remove or deprecate the custom implementation in `Stream.tsx`
     3. Ensure any components using the old provider are updated
   - **Justification:** Standardizing on the official SDK provides better long-term maintainability, automatic updates with SDK changes, and consistent behavior with the LangGraph ecosystem.

3. **Implement Thread Initialization Flow:**

   - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
   - **File(s) to Modify:** `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx`
   - **Action:**

     1. When an `rfpId` is present but no `threadId` exists:

        ```typescript
        useEffect(() => {
          const initializeThread = async () => {
            if (rfpId && !threadId) {
              try {
                // Call our custom workflow initialization endpoint
                const response = await fetch(
                  `${baseApiUrl}/api/rfp/workflow/init`,
                  {
                    method: "POST",
                    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
                    body: JSON.stringify({ rfpId }),
                  }
                );

                if (!response.ok)
                  throw new Error(
                    `Failed to initialize workflow: ${response.statusText}`
                  );

                const { threadId: newThreadId } = await response.json();

## Next Immediate Action

Review API handlers to ensure consistent OrchestratorService usage (Phase 5.3, Step 4), followed by updating StreamProvider for SDK integration (Phase 5.4, Step 1)

## Current Context

### Core Architecture & Design Principles

Our system is transitioning to a standardized thread persistence approach using LangGraph's official PostgresSaver. This refactor eliminates custom checkpointing code in favor of the maintained LangGraph components while preserving our business logic.

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Deterministic Thread IDs**: We construct thread IDs using the pattern `user-[userId]::rfp-[rfpId]::proposal` via the `constructProposalThreadId` utility. This provides:

   - Predictable thread recovery without database lookups
   - Natural namespacing by user and RFP
   - Compatibility with LangGraph's thread_id conventions

2. **Single Checkpointer Instance**: The application uses a single checkpointer instance created via `createRobustCheckpointer()`:

   - Initialized once during service startup, not per thread
   - Thread-specific state is isolated by providing the thread_id in RunnableConfig at invocation time
   - Provides graceful fallback to in-memory storage during development

3. **Orchestrator-Driven Thread Management**: All thread operations are centralized in OrchestratorService:

   - `initOrGetProposalWorkflow(userId, rfpId)` - Determines if a thread exists and returns its ID/state
   - `startProposalGeneration(threadId, userId, rfpId)` - Initializes a new thread with proper state
   - All graph invocations use `{ configurable: { thread_id: threadId } }` in RunnableConfig

4. **RFP Document Loading Flow**:
   - The system no longer passes raw document data in the API
   - Instead, it passes an rfpId through the workflow initialization endpoint
   - The initial state includes a system message prompting the loading of the document
   - The `documentLoaderNode` loads the document content using the rfpId

#### Component Interactions

1. **Frontend Initiates Workflow**:

   ```
   Frontend → /api/rfp/workflow/init (POST) → OrchestratorService.initOrGetProposalWorkflow → Returns threadId
   ```

2. **Thread Initialization (New Thread)**:

   ```
   OrchestratorService.startProposalGeneration → Sets initial state with rfpId → Invokes graph with thread_id → PostgresSaver persists state
   ```

3. **Thread Resumption (Existing Thread)**:

   ```
   OrchestratorService.getState(threadId) → PostgresSaver.get({ configurable: { thread_id } }) → Returns persisted state
   ```

4. **Message Processing**:
   ```
   Frontend → /api/rfp/chat (POST) → OrchestratorService.processChatMessage → Invokes graph with thread_id → PostgresSaver persists updated state
   ```

#### Important Technical Details

1. **PostgreSQL Schema Requirements**:

   - Table: `checkpoints`
   - Required columns: `id` (thread_id), `ts` (timestamp), `channel_values` (state JSON), `channel_versions`, `versions_seen`, `pending_sends`
   - `id` and `ts` should be indexed for performance

2. **Thread ID Construction**:

   ```typescript
   // From lib/utils/threads.ts
   export function constructProposalThreadId(
     userId: string,
     rfpId: string
   ): string {
     return `user-${userId}::rfp-${rfpId}::proposal`;
   }
   ```

3. **Security Considerations**:

   - Row Level Security should be implemented in Supabase to ensure users can only access their own threads
   - The userId should be encoded in metadata or the thread_id to enforce proper isolation

4. **Compatibility Notes**:
   - The previous system using ThreadService with UUID-based IDs in proposal_thread_mappings can coexist
   - Long-term plan is to phase out ThreadService as the deterministic thread_id pattern provides all needed functionality
   - Existing code should be updated to use OrchestratorService methods rather than direct checkpointer interactions

### Implementation Progress

1. **Completed Core Components**:

   - ✅ Consolidated to PostgresSaver and removed custom SupabaseCheckpointer
   - ✅ Fixed the signature of `startProposalGeneration(threadId, userId, rfpId)`
   - ✅ Updated graph.ts to create checkpointer without binding to a specific thread
   - ✅ Implemented the thread_id construction utility

2. **In Progress**:

   - 🔄 Reviewing API handlers to ensure consistent thread_id usage (Phase 5.3, Step 4)
   - 🔄 Preparing frontend integration with the refactored backend (Phase 5.4)

3. **Upcoming Work**:
   - Frontend StreamProvider updates for LangGraph SDK integration
   - Thread persistence testing
   - Documentation and production readiness

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

1. **Common Issues**:

   - Missing thread_id in RunnableConfig leads to mixed state or lost updates
   - Inconsistent thread ID format prevents thread resumption
   - Database permission issues can block checkpointer operations

2. **Diagnostic Steps**:
   - Verify thread ID construction is consistent between API calls
   - Check Supabase logs for database connection or permission issues
   - Examine the checkpoints table to confirm proper state serialization
   - Use logging to trace thread ID flow through the application

### Sub-Phase 5.4: Frontend Integration and Thread Persistence Testing

1. **Update StreamProvider Configuration for LangGraph SDK Integration:**

   - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
   - **File(s) to Modify:** `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx`
   - **Action:**
     1. Fix type errors in `useTypedStream` initialization:
        ```typescript
        const streamValue = useTypedStream({
          apiUrl: directApiUrl || "http://localhost:2024", // Default LangGraph server port
          assistantId: assistantId || "proposal-generation", // Standardize on correct agent ID
          streamMode: "values",
          threadId: threadId || undefined, // Pass custom threadId from our API
        });
        ```
     2. Ensure proper error handling for initialization failures
     3. Add comprehensive logging at key points in the thread initialization flow
   - **Justification:** Eliminates type errors and aligns with LangGraph SDK expectations. Using the correct `assistantId` ensures proper agent targeting, while the fallback values improve robustness.

2. **Standardize on the Official SDK Implementation:**

                  `${baseApiUrl}/api/rfp/workflow/init`,
                  {
                    method: "POST",
                    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
                    body: JSON.stringify({ rfpId }),
                  }
                );

                if (!response.ok)
                  throw new Error(
                    `Failed to initialize workflow: ${response.statusText}`
                  );

                const { threadId: newThreadId } = await response.json();
