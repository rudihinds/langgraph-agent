# Checkpoint Refactor - Progress Report

**Overall Goal:** Ensure reliable, persistent checkpointing with the latest LangGraph.js version and Supabase, and resolve critical graph execution errors that block testing.

---

## Phase 1: Resolve Core Graph Execution and Connectivity Blockers

**Goal:** Fix critical errors preventing checkpointer testing and establish a working connection with Supabase using the official `PostgresSaver`.

### ◻️ Step 1.1: Fix Tool Call Sequencing Error (`BadRequestError`)

- **Status:** New
- **Issue:** OpenAI `BadRequestError` ("An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'.") prevents multi-turn conversation testing, hindering verification of any checkpointer.
- **Action:**
  1. Investigate `processToolsNode` (likely in `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/toolProcessor.ts`) to ensure it generates a `ToolMessage` with a matching `tool_call_id` for every incoming `tool_call`.
  2. Review message history assembly in `chatAgentNode` and any relevant state reducers (e.g., `messagesStateReducer`) to confirm `ToolMessage`s are correctly sequenced and included before subsequent LLM calls.
  3. Add detailed logging in tool processing and message assembly points to trace `tool_call_id`s and message order.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/chatAgent.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/toolProcessor.ts`, state reducers.

### ✅ Step 1.2: Diagnose and Fix `PostgresSaver` Connection Issue

- **Status:** Done (Previously DNS Resolution Issue, reframed to Connection Issue)
- **Original Issue:** Official `PostgresSaver` (used via `robust-checkpointer.ts`) failed to connect to Supabase due to `Error: Connection terminated due to connection timeout`. Initial suspicion was DNS, but `nslookup` worked. `psql` and `nc` tests to `db.rqwgqyhonjnzvgwxbrvh.supabase.co:5432` also hung, even from different networks.
- **Root Cause:** The application was using the "Direct connection" hostname (`db.rqwgqyhonjnzvgwxbrvh.supabase.co`) provided by Supabase. However, successful connection was achieved using the "Session pooler" hostname (`aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com`) on the same port (`5432`), with the pooler-specific user format (`postgres.rqwgqyhonjnzvgwxbrvh`).
- **Solution:**
  1. Verified Supabase network restrictions were open ("Allow all IP addresses").
  2. Tested `psql` with various endpoints provided by Supabase.
  3. Successfully connected `psql` using: `postgresql://postgres.rqwgqyhonjnzvgwxbrvh:YOUR-PASSWORD@aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`.
  4. Updated environment variables to reflect the correct "Session pooler" details:
     - `SUPABASE_DB_HOST` to `aws-0-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com`
     - `SUPABASE_DB_USER` to `postgres.rqwgqyhonjnzvgwxbrvh` (or `postgres` if project ref is part of host)
     - Ensured `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_DB_PORT` (5432), and `SUPABASE_DB_NAME` (postgres) were correct.
  5. Application now successfully connects to Supabase using `PostgresSaver`.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** Environment variable files (`.env`), `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` (verified it uses the correct ENV vars).

### ◻️ Step 1.3: Verify `PostgresSaver` with Official LangGraph Implementation

- **Status:** New
- **Pre-requisites:** Step 1.1 (Tool Call Error Fix) and Step 1.2 (DNS Fix) must be completed.
- **Action:**
  1. Ensure `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` correctly instantiates `PostgresSaver` using `PostgresSaver.fromConnString()` as per official LangGraph documentation.
  2. Confirm that `await checkpointer.setup();` is called after `PostgresSaver` instantiation, as required by the documentation, if not already present.
  3. Verify that `thread_id` is consistently passed in the `configurable` object for all graph invocations.
  4. Conduct end-to-end testing of conversation persistence using the `PostgresSaver` connected to Supabase. Verify that state is saved, retrieved across requests/sessions, and listed correctly.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` (to ensure it uses `robust-checkpointer.ts` and passes `thread_id`).

### ◻️ Step 1.4: Stabilize with Official `MemorySaver` for Development/Fallback

- **Status:** Partially Done (Fallback exists, but needs verification after Tool Call Error Fix)
- **Pre-requisite:** Step 1.1 (Tool Call Error Fix) must be completed.
- **Action:**
  1. Confirm `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` correctly uses `new MemorySaver()` (imported from `@langchain/langgraph` or `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint`) as a fallback.
  2. Thoroughly test multi-turn conversation persistence with `MemorySaver` after the `BadRequestError` is resolved.
  3. Document its behavior: state persists within a session for a given `thread_id` but is lost on server restart.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`.

## Phase 2: Address TypeScript Build Errors and Dependency Upgrades

**Goal:** Resolve TypeScript compatibility issues arising from LangGraph and related dependency updates to ensure a stable build.

### ◻️ Step 2.1: Resolve TypeScript Build Errors

- **Status:** Previously ❌ Step 1.7 (Failed)
- **Issue:** `npm run build` produces numerous TypeScript errors (406 errors across 48 files reported previously) after dependency upgrades, mainly due to type definition changes in LangGraph versions.
- **Action:**
  1. Create a dedicated branch (e.g., `fix/dependency-types`) for this effort.
  2. Incrementally upgrade LangGraph-related packages (e.g., `@langchain/langgraph`, `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`, `@langchain/core`) one by one or in small, related groups.
  3. After each upgrade, run `npm run build` (or `tsc`) and address any new TypeScript errors by updating type annotations, method signatures, and import paths as required by the new library versions. Refer to official LangGraph migration guides or changelogs if available.
  4. Pay close attention to types related to `BaseCheckpointSaver`, `Checkpoint`, and other persistence mechanisms.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/package.json`, numerous `*.ts` files across the backend, particularly those involved in graph definition, state, and persistence.

## Phase 3: Re-evaluate and Refactor Custom Checkpointer Adapters (If Still Necessary)

**Goal:** Align custom checkpointer adapters (`LangGraphCheckpointer`, `MemoryLangGraphCheckpointer`) with the `BaseCheckpointSaver` contract from the current LangGraph version, _only if official `PostgresSaver` and `MemorySaver` prove insufficient for project needs after Phase 1 and 2 are completed and thoroughly tested._

### ◻️ Step 3.1: Analyze Necessity of Custom Adapters

- **Status:** New
- **Action:**
  1. Once Phase 1 and Phase 2 are complete, and persistence is working reliably with official `PostgresSaver` and `MemorySaver`.
  2. Critically evaluate if the custom logic within your `SupabaseCheckpointer`
