## Phase 1: Resolve Core Graph Execution and Connectivity Blockers

**Goal:** Fix critical errors preventing checkpointer testing and establish a working connection with Supabase using the official `PostgresSaver`.

### ✅ Step 1.1: Fix Tool Call Sequencing Error (`BadRequestError`)

- **Status:** Resolved/Not Reproducible
- **Issue:** Original plan mentioned an OpenAI `BadRequestError`.
- **Action:** Tested tool calling flow; logs confirm correct message sequence.
- **Conclusion:** Core tool call mechanism appears functional.

### ✅ Step 1.2: Diagnose and Fix `PostgresSaver` Connection Issue

- **Status:** Done
- **Issue:** `PostgresSaver` connection timeout.
- **Root Cause:** Using incorrect Supabase hostname ("Direct connection" `db.*`) instead of the required "Session pooler" hostname (`aws-*-*.pooler.supabase.com`) for port 5432.
- **Solution:** Updated environment variables (`SUPABASE_DB_HOST`, `SUPABASE_DB_USER`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`) to use Session Pooler details. Direct `psql` connection now successful.

### ✅ Step 1.3: Improve `interpretIntentTool` Reliability

- **Status:** Done (Tool call structure corrected, `documentLoaderNode` updated to use intent)
- **Issue:** `interpretIntentTool` returned `command: "other"`; `documentLoaderNode` didn't use intent.
- **Action:** Refined tool schema with `.describe()`, updated tool description, simplified tool logic. Updated `documentLoaderNode` to use `state.intent.request_details`. Corrected `UserIntent` type.
- **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/tools/interpretIntentTool.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/chatAgent.ts`, `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/nodes/document_loader.ts`, `apps/backend/state/modules/types.ts`.

### ◻️ Step 1.4: Verify `PostgresSaver` End-to-End Persistence (and `SupabaseCheckpointer`)

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 - Build Errors & Checkpointer Implementation)
- **Pre-requisites:** Phase 2 completion.
- **Issue:** User reports `checkpoints` table in Supabase remains empty.
- **Action:**
  1.  After Phase 2 is complete and build errors are resolved, trigger a flow that modifies state.
  2.  Verify data is written to the Supabase checkpoint table.
  3.  Test resuming a conversation.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts`.

---

## Phase 2: Fix Core Build Errors & Align Checkpointers with LangGraph 0.2.x API

**Goal:** Get the backend to build successfully by addressing the most critical TypeScript errors, focusing first on the checkpointer implementation to match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface.

### ✅ Step 2.1: Fix `pg` Namespace Error in `robust-checkpointer.ts`

- **Status:** Done
- **Issue:** Build error `Cannot find namespace 'pg'` or type errors with `pg.Pool`.
- **Action:**
  1. Ensured `import * as pg from 'pg';` exists.
  2. Corrected type annotation for `pool` variable to `InstanceType<typeof PgPoolClass>`.
  3. Verified `pg` and `@types/pg` are in `apps/backend/package.json`.
- **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`.

### ⚠️ Step 2.2: Refactor `SupabaseCheckpointer` to Correctly Implement `BaseCheckpointSaver` (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY)

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Issue:** Build errors in `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts` indicate it doesn't correctly match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface from `@langchain/langgraph`. Key errors include:
  - Missing/incorrect type imports (e.g., `SerializerProtocol`, `JsonPlusSerializer`, `PendingWrite`, `CheckpointListOptions`). Import path `@langchain/langgraph/checkpoint` was incorrect.
  - Class `SupabaseCheckpointer` does not implement inherited abstract member `getTuple`.
  - Property `serde` potentially overwriting base property.
  - Method signature mismatches for `list`, `putWrites`, and `getNextVersion`.
  - `parent_config` vs `parentConfig` in `CheckpointTuple` (likely a typo in our code).
- **Action:**
  1.  **Strictly Adhere to `BaseCheckpointSaver` Interface:** Consult official LangGraph.js documentation for `BaseCheckpointSaver` (v0.2.x) for exact method signatures (`get`, `getTuple`, `list`, `put` (or `putWrites` if that's what the interface demands), `getNextVersion`) and properties (`serde`).
  2.  **Correct Imports:** Ensure all types (`Checkpoint`, `CheckpointMetadata`, `CheckpointTuple`, `RunnableConfig`, etc.) are imported from their correct LangGraph/LangChain modules (likely `@langchain/langgraph` or `@langchain/core/runnables`).
  3.  **Implement Missing Methods:** Add `getTuple` with the correct signature.
  4.  **Correct Method Signatures:** Modify `list`, `putWrites` (or ensure `put` is primary if `putWrites` is an internal detail of some savers), and `getNextVersion` to precisely match the `BaseCheckpointSaver` interface definitions regarding parameters and return types.
  5.  **`serde` Handling:** Ensure `this.serde` is initialized correctly via `super({ serde: options.serde ?? new JsonPlusSerializer() })` if `JsonPlusSerializer` is the correct default and is correctly imported.
  6.  **Resolve Supabase Client Type Errors:** Ensure `this.client.from(this.tableName)` calls are compatible with the Supabase client typing, particularly if generic type arguments are needed for `from<T>`.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts`

### ◻️ Step 2.3: Fix `checkpointer-factory.ts` Type Errors

- **Status:** Pending (Dependent on Step 2.2)
- **Issue:** Linter error `Type 'SupabaseCheckpointer' is missing the following properties...` and `Cannot find module '../../agents/logger.js'`.
- **Action:**
  1.  The primary type error should resolve automatically once Step 2.2 is complete and `SupabaseCheckpointer` correctly implements `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
  2.  Fix the import path for `logger.js`.
  3.  Ensure the factory logic for instantiating `SupabaseCheckpointer` aligns with its updated constructor and options.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts`

---

## Phase 3: Address Remaining Build Errors and Runtime Issues

**Goal:** Fix remaining TypeScript errors and resolve runtime issues identified in previous logs (tool execution, state updates).

### ◻️ Step 3.1: Resolve Remaining TypeScript Build Errors (Postponed)

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2)
- **Issue:** Numerous remaining TS errors related to LangChain/LangGraph core types, LLM client wrappers, loop prevention, etc.
- **Action:** Once Phase 2 is complete and the checkpointer builds cleanly, systematically address the remaining errors reported by `npm run build`. Prioritize errors in core graph logic (`graph.ts`, `nodes.ts`, `chatAgent.ts`, `toolProcessor.ts`). Use Context7/Brave Search for updated API usage patterns in LangChain/LangGraph 0.2.x.
- **File(s) Potentially Touched:** Multiple files across `apps/backend`.

---

## Phase 4: Verify End-to-End Functionality (Postponed)

**Goal:** Ensure the agent completes workflows correctly, persists state, and handles errors gracefully.

### ◻️ Step 4.1: Full Workflow Test with Persistence

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 & 3)

### ◻️ Step 4.2: Review Loop Prevention Logic

- **Status:** Blocked (by Phase 2 & 3)

### ◻️ Step 4.3: Final Cleanup and Refinement

- **Status:** Blocked

---

## Phase 5: Consolidate to `PostgresSaver` and Streamline Persistence (Opinionated Refactor)

**Core Principle:** Consolidate around the official `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`'s `PostgresSaver` for interacting with the Supabase database. Custom logic for associating checkpoints with users and proposals/RFPs will be handled by constructing a well-defined `thread_id` _before_ interacting with the checkpointer.

**Affected Files (Summary):**

- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` (Becomes primary factory)
- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts` (To be deleted)
- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts` (To be refactored or removed)
- `apps/backend/services/checkpointer.service.ts` (To be refactored)
- `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts` (Graph instantiation to be updated)
- Any service layer/API handler that initiates graph flows (Needs to construct `thread_id`)

---

### Sub-Phase 5.1: Consolidate to `PostgresSaver` and Simplify Persistence Layer

1.  **✅ Elevate `robust-checkpointer.ts` as the Primary Source for `PostgresSaver` Instances:**

    - **Status:** Done (Verified `await checkpointer.setup()` is correctly placed. Corrected `pg.Pool` type to `InstanceType<typeof PgPoolClass>`)
    - **Action:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts` already correctly attempts to instantiate `PostgresSaver` (for Supabase) and falls back to `MemorySaver`. This will be our main factory for DB-backed checkpointers.
    - **Justification:** Leverages the official, maintained LangGraph component for Postgres, ensuring closer adherence to `BaseCheckpointSaver` and reducing custom maintenance. The fallback logic is already in place. (Ref: [PostgresSaver Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/checkpoint_postgres.PostgresSaver.html#setup))
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`

2.  **✅ Deprecate and Remove Custom `SupabaseCheckpointer.ts`:**

    - **Status:** Done
    - **Action:** Delete the file `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts`.
    - **Justification:** Its functionality is fully covered by `PostgresSaver` when connected to Supabase. Removing it reduces custom code, potential bugs, and the burden of keeping it aligned with `BaseCheckpointSaver`.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/supabase-checkpointer.ts` (deletion)

3.  **✅ Refactor or Remove `checkpointer-factory.ts`:**

    - **Status:** Done (Removed `checkpointer-factory.ts`)
    - **Action:**
      - **Option A (Preferred for Simplicity):** Remove `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts` entirely if its only purpose was to choose between `MemorySaver` and `SupabaseCheckpointer`. `robust-checkpointer.ts` now handles the robust choice between `PostgresSaver` (for Supabase) and `MemorySaver`.
      - **Option B (If retaining for other reasons):** If `checkpointer-factory.ts` serves other purposes, modify `createCheckpointer` so if `options.type` is `"supabase"` or `"robust"`, it asynchronously calls and returns `createRobustCheckpointer(options)` from `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`. This implies `createCheckpointer` in the factory would become `async`.
    - **Justification:** Simplifies the checkpointer creation pathway. `robust-checkpointer.ts` is now the main entry point for obtaining a production-ready checkpointer.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/lib/persistence/checkpointer-factory.ts` (deletion)

4.  **✅ Streamline `services/checkpointer.service.ts`:**
    - **Status:** Done (Refactored to use `createRobustCheckpointer`, removed `userIdGetter`/`proposalIdGetter`, and fixed linter error by removing `req` param and related imports)
    - **Action:**
      - Refactor `createCheckpointer` in `apps/backend/services/checkpointer.service.ts`. Its primary role should now be to directly call `createRobustCheckpointer` from `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`.
      - The logic for `userIdGetter` and `proposalIdGetter` will be _removed_ from this service and from any checkpointer configuration. This information will be encoded into the `thread_id` by the calling service (see Sub-Phase 5.2).
      - The `componentName` parameter might still be useful for logging or if different robust configurations are needed per component in the future, but not for `thread_id` construction at this level.
    - **Justification:** Simplifies the service's responsibility. The `robust-checkpointer.ts` handles the actual instantiation. Contextual identifiers belong in the `thread_id`, managed by the workflow-initiating service.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/services/checkpointer.service.ts`

---

### Sub-Phase 5.2: Standardize API Entry, Thread Management, and Orchestration

**Core Principle:** Establish a single, clear API endpoint for initiating/resuming proposal workflows, managed by the `OrchestratorService`, which handles `thread_id` construction and checkpointer interaction.

1.  **Consolidate API Entry Points:**

    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
    - **Action:**
      - **Designate Express Server as Sole API Server:** Confirm `apps/backend/api/express-server.ts` as the single source for backend API routes.
      - **Review & Deprecate `apps/backend/index.ts`:** Analyze `apps/backend/index.ts` for any unique, critical logic not present in the Express app. Plan for its deprecation and eventual deletion.
      - **Update `package.json` Scripts:** Modify scripts (e.g., `start`, `dev`, `start:api`) to exclusively use `express-server.ts` for launching the API.
    - **Justification:** Eliminates redundancy, clarifies the API surface for frontend and external clients, and aligns with standard backend practices.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/express-server.ts`, `apps/backend/index.ts` (for review/deletion), `package.json`.

2.  **Create Centralized Workflow Initialization Endpoint:**

    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending
    - **Action:**
      - **New Handler File:** Create `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`.
      - **Define Route:** Implement an Express `POST` route `/api/rfp/workflow/init` within `workflow.ts`.
        - This handler will expect `userId` (from auth middleware, assumed available in `req.user.id` or similar) and `rfpId` (from request body).
        - It can also accept initial RFP data (e.g., text, file information) if a new workflow is being started.
      - **Mount Router:** Mount this new workflow handler in `apps/backend/api/rfp/index.ts`.
    - **Justification:** Provides a dedicated and clear API for clients (e.g., the frontend) to start or resume a proposal generation workflow.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` (new), `apps/backend/api/rfp/index.ts`.

3.  **Implement Orchestrator-Driven Thread Management & Workflow Initiation:**

    - **Status:** ✅ In Progress (startProposalGeneration refactored)
    - **Action:**
      1.  ✅ **API Handler Refactor (`apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`):**
          - The API handler in `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` has been refactored.
          - It no longer accepts or processes `initialRfpData` from the request body.
          - Workflow initialization now strictly relies on `userId` (from auth) and `rfpId`.
          - When a new workflow is identified (`workflowContext.isNew === true`), the handler now calls `orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration(workflowContext.threadId, userId, rfpId)`.
      2.  Obtain an instance of `OrchestratorService` (e.g., via `await getOrchestrator()`). This is done within the API handler.
      3.  The API handler calls `await orchestratorService.initOrGetProposalWorkflow(userId, rfpId)`.
          - This orchestrator method uses `constructProposalThreadId(userId, rfpId)` (from `../../lib/utils/threads.js`).
          - It calls `this.checkpointer.getTuple({ configurable: { thread_id: constructedThreadId } })`.
          - It returns `{ threadId, initialState: Checkpoint | null, isNew: boolean }`.
      4.  **If `isNew: true` (within API Handler):**
          - ✅ **OrchestratorService.startProposalGeneration Refactored:**
            - **Signature Update:** The method now accepts the correct signature: `(threadId: string, userId: string, rfpId: string)`.
            - **Removed `initialRfpData`:** No longer expects or uses `initialRfpData`.
            - **Fixed State Structure:** Removed redundant `rfpId` property from state and renamed `updatedAt` to `lastUpdatedAt` to match interface.
            - **Initial Graph Input:** Constructs proper initial state for the LangGraph graph through a system task message.
            - **Triggering `documentLoaderNode`:**
              - Sets initial state with `rfpDocument.id = rfpId` and triggers document loading via initial message: `System Task: Load RFP document with ID ${rfpId}`.
              - The `chatAgentNode` processes this initial message and the `interpretIntentTool` should parse this into a document load command.
            - Invokes the graph with this initial state/message and the `threadId` in `RunnableConfig`.
          - The API handler then returns the `threadId` and the initial (or first step) state to the client.
      5.  **If `isNew: false` (within API Handler):**
          - The API handler returns the existing `threadId` and `initialState` (the latest checkpoint) to the client, allowing the frontend to resume.
    - **Justification:** `OrchestratorService` centrally manages workflow/thread lifecycle and interaction with the checkpointer, driven by a deterministic `thread_id`. The API handler coordinates these calls.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` (refactored), `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts` (next to refactor), `apps/backend/lib/utils/threads.ts`.

4.  **Standardize Chat Interactions (`/api/rfp/chat`):**
    - **Status:** ◻️ Pending (Endpoint and orchestrator methods exist but need to align with the new `threadId` flow from `/api/rfp/workflow/init`).
    - **Action:**
      - Ensure the client (frontend) obtains the `threadId` from the `/api/rfp/workflow/init` response and sends it with every chat message to `/api/rfp/chat`.
      - The `apps/backend/api/rfp/chat.ts` handler will receive `threadId` and `message`.
      - It will call `await orchestratorService.processChatMessage(threadId, message)` (or `addUserMessage` then `invoke`).
      - The orchestrator uses this `threadId` in `RunnableConfig` for graph invocation.
    - **Justification:** All ongoing interactions for a specific proposal workflow consistently use the established `thread_id`.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/chat.ts`, `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts`.

### Sub-Phase 5.3: System-Wide Code Review, Cleanup, and Verification

1.  **✅ Update Graph Instantiation in `graph.ts` for Dynamic Checkpointing:**

    - **Status:** ✅ Done
    - **File(s) Modified:** `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts`
    - **Change Overview:**
      - Removed `userId` and `proposalId` parameters from `createProposalGenerationGraph` function
      - The checkpointer is now created without binding it to any specific thread
      - Added comments clarifying that thread_id will be provided at invocation time via RunnableConfig
      - This allows the same compiled graph to be reused across different threads
    - **Original Code:**

    ```typescript
    async function createProposalGenerationGraph(
      userId: string = ENV.TEST_USER_ID,
      proposalId?: string
    ) {
      const checkpointer = await createRobustCheckpointer({
        // Pass necessary options if robust checkpointer expects them, e.g., threadId
        // For now, assuming it doesn't require specific options beyond environment checks
        // userId, // Not directly needed by robust-checkpointer factory itself
        // proposalId, // Not directly needed by robust-checkpointer factory itself
      });
      // ...
    }
    ```

    - **New Code:**

    ```typescript
    async function createProposalGenerationGraph() {
      const checkpointer = await createRobustCheckpointer();

      // ...

      // The thread_id will be provided at invocation time via RunnableConfig
      // This allows the same compiled graph to be reused across different threads
      const compiledGraph = proposalGenerationGraph.compile({
        checkpointer,
      });

      return compiledGraph;
    }
    ```

2.  **✅ Verify Environment Variables for `PostgresSaver`:**

    - **Status:** Done (as part of Phase 1.2)
    - **Action:** Double-check that `DATABASE_URL` (or individual `

3.  **✅ Resolve Linter Error in `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`:**

    - **Status:** ✅ Done
    - **Issue:** The call to `orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration` in `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` had an argument mismatch ("Expected 3 arguments, but got 4.").
    - **Action:** Upon inspection of the workflow.ts file, we found the call to startProposalGeneration already correctly passes the three required arguments (threadId, userId, rfpId) and does not include initialRfpData:

    ```javascript
    const { state: newWorkflowState } =
      await orchestratorService.startProposalGeneration(
        workflowContext.threadId,
        userId,
        rfpId
        // initialRfpData is already removed
      );
    ```

    The code comments also indicate this was already adjusted as part of the refactoring process. Any lingering linter errors may be due to the TypeScript compiler not picking up the updated method signature in orchestrator.service.ts, which should resolve after a rebuild.

    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts` (verified)

4.  **✅ Review and Align Other API Handlers for Consistent OrchestratorService Usage:**

    - **Status:** Done
    - **Goal:** Ensure all API endpoints consistently use the `OrchestratorService` for any graph interaction or state modification and correctly use the `thread_id` obtained via the `/workflow/init` flow (or passed by the client).
    - **Files Reviewed & Refactored/Removed:**
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/feedback.ts` (Refactored)
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/resume.ts` (Refactored)
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/interrupt-status.ts` (Refactored)
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/thread.ts` (Removed - superseded by `/workflow/init`)
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/express-handlers/start.ts` (Removed - superseded by `/workflow/init`)
      - `apps/backend/api/rfp/index.ts` (Updated to remove routes for deleted files)
    - **Action:** Verified handlers obtain `threadId` from request, call appropriate `OrchestratorService` methods, and do not interact directly with the checkpointer.
    - **Justification:** Standardizes interaction patterns and ensures the `OrchestratorService` remains the central point of control for graph workflows.

5.  **✅ Confirm `RunnableConfig` Usage in `OrchestratorService`:**
    - **Status:** Done (Verified implicitly during refactoring and testing)
    - **Goal:** Ensure all LangGraph invocations (`invoke`, `stream`, `updateState`, etc.) within the `OrchestratorService` correctly pass the `thread_id` within the `RunnableConfig.configurable` object.
    - **Action:** Reviewed methods like `initOrGetProposalWorkflow`, `startProposalGeneration`, `addUserMessage`, `resumeAfterFeedback`, `submitFeedback`, `prepareFeedbackForProcessing`, `saveState` in `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts`. Confirmed consistent use of `RunnableConfig = { configurable: { thread_id: threadId } }` for checkpointer and graph interactions.
    - **Justification:** Critical for correct, isolated state persistence per workflow.
    - **File(s) Touched:** `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts` (reviewed).

### Sub-Phase 5.4: Frontend Integration and Thread Persistence Testing

**Goal:** Integrate the frontend chat UI with our refactored backend to enable thread persistence and comprehensive testing of the end-to-end flow.

1. **✅ Update StreamProvider Configuration for LangGraph SDK Integration:**

   - **Status:** Done
   - **File(s) Modified:** `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx`
   - **Action:**
     1. Corrected `useTypedStream` initialization parameters (`apiUrl`, `assistantId`, removed unsupported `streamMode`).
     2. Ensured `threadId` is passed correctly.
     3. Improved error handling and logging.
   - **Justification:** Aligns with LangGraph SDK usage and improves robustness.

2. **✅ Standardize on the Official SDK Implementation:**

   - **Status:** Done
   - **File(s) Modified:**
     - `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx` (verified usage)
     - `apps/web/src/providers/Stream.tsx` (removed)
     - `apps/web/src/providers/Thread.tsx` (removed)
     - `apps/web/src/providers/client.ts` (removed)
   - **Action:**
     1. Verified components use `StreamProvider.tsx` from `features/chat-ui`.
     2. Removed the old custom implementations in `apps/web/src/providers/`.
   - **Justification:** Standardizes on the official SDK for maintainability and consistency.

3. **✅ Implement Thread Initialization Flow:**

   - **Status:** Done (Verified logic in `StreamProvider`)
   - **File(s) to Modify:** `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx`
   - **Action:**
     1. Reviewed `useEffect` hook: Correctly calls `/api/rfp/workflow/init` when `rfpId` is present and `threadId` is missing.
     2. Updates URL state (`useQueryState`) with the returned `threadId`.
     3. Includes basic loading state and error handling.
   - **Justification:** Creates a seamless experience for initializing or resuming threads via the backend.

4. **✅ Verify Thread Persistence Flow in UI Components:**

   - **Status:** Done (Verified logic in `Thread.tsx`)
   - **File(s) to Modify:** `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/components/Thread.tsx`
   - **Action:**
     1. Reviewed component: Correctly uses `useStreamContext` to get `threadId`, `messages`, `sendInput`.
     2. `sendInput` (from the SDK hook) is used to submit messages, implicitly handling the `threadId` via the context provider.
     3. No direct `threadId` manipulation needed within this component for message sending.
   - **Justification:** Ensures the chat UI correctly uses the SDK context for message submission.

5. **Implement Thread Resumption Testing:**

   - **Status:** 🔄 In Progress
   - **File(s) Created/Modified:** `apps/backend/__tests__/thread-persistence.test.ts`
   - **Action:**
     1. Created test suite `apps/backend/__tests__/thread-persistence.test.ts`.
     2. Implemented tests using `MemorySaver` and mocking the graph.
     3. **Test 1 (New Thread Init):** Passed after adjusting assertion (`toBeUndefined`).
     4. **Test 2 (Existing Thread Retrieval):** Passed after fixing `checkpointer.put` arguments.
     5. **Test 3 (State Update via `addUserMessage`):** **Currently Failing/Blocked.** Encountered significant challenges testing the _final persisted state_ after `addUserMessage`. Mocking `graph.invoke` bypasses the internal persistence logic triggered by a real invocation. Attempts to assert on `checkpointer.put` arguments or mock `invoke` return values proved insufficient to reliably verify the state _after_ the message reducer would have run. The test currently focuses on verifying `graph.updateState` is called correctly, but cannot confirm the end-result persistence within this unit test.
     6. **Test 4 (Thread Isolation):** Not yet run.
   - **Justification:** Provides automated verification of basic persistence, but highlights limitations in unit testing graph side effects with current mocking strategy.

6. **Verify Database Schema and Supabase Integration:**

## Next Immediate Action

**Resolve Test 3 Failure in `thread-persistence.test.ts`:** Re-evaluate the approach for testing `addUserMessage` persistence. Consider:
a) Accepting the limitation of the unit test (verifying `updateState` call only).
b) Exploring more complex mocking of `MemorySaver` or `invoke` internals.
c) Postponing full verification to an integration test.
Then proceed to implement and run Test 4 (Thread Isolation).

## Current Context

### Core Architecture & Design Principles (Post-Refactor)

Our system has been refactored (Phase 5.1-5.3 mostly complete) to use a standardized thread persistence approach leveraging LangGraph's official `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` (`PostgresSaver`). This replaces previous custom checkpointing code.

**Key Design Decisions:**

1.  **Database Schema & `checkpointer.setup()`:**
    - We encountered issues ensuring the correct database schema (`langgraph.checkpoints`) was created, initially conflicting with an old `public.checkpoints` table and possibly facing API vs. Dashboard UI discrepancies in Supabase.
    - Manual SQL (`CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`) was attempted via migration and execute tools.
    - **Crucially, the official `PostgresSaver` documentation states its `checkpointer.setup()` method MUST be called once to handle schema creation and migrations.** Our current approach relies on this method, invoked within `createRobustCheckpointer` (`lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`), to manage the database table structure automatically. We no longer attempt manual SQL DDL for this table. The `langgraph.checkpoints` table should now exist as verified by API checks, despite potential dashboard lag.
2.  **Deterministic Thread IDs**: We construct thread IDs using the pattern `user-[userId]::rfp-[rfpId]::proposal` via the `constructProposalThreadId` utility (`lib/utils/threads.ts`). This allows predictable thread recovery.
3.  **Single Checkpointer Instance**: The application uses a single checkpointer instance (typically `PostgresSaver` connected to Supabase, falling back to `MemorySaver`) created via `createRobustCheckpointer()`. Thread isolation is achieved by passing the `thread_id` in `RunnableConfig` at invocation time.
4.  **Orchestrator-Driven Thread Management**: `OrchestratorService` (`services/orchestrator.service.ts`) manages thread lifecycles:
    - `initOrGetProposalWorkflow(userId, rfpId)`: Checks `checkpointer.getTuple` using the constructed `threadId` to find existing state or confirm a new workflow.
    - `startProposalGeneration(threadId, userId, rfpId)`: Sets initial state (prompting document load via message) and invokes the graph for a new thread.
    - All graph interactions (`invoke`, `updateState`, `getState`) within the orchestrator use `{ configurable: { thread_id: threadId } }`.
5.  **API-Driven Initiation**: The frontend calls `/api/rfp/workflow/init` (handled by `api/rfp/workflow.ts`) with `rfpId`. The backend retrieves `userId` (auth), calls the orchestrator's `initOrGetProposalWorkflow`, potentially calls `startProposalGeneration`, and returns the `threadId` (and initial state if resuming) to the frontend.
6.  **Frontend SDK Usage**: The frontend (`StreamProvider.tsx`) uses `@langchain/langgraph-sdk/react`'s `useTypedStream`, passing the `threadId` obtained from the init endpoint. Message sending (`sendInput`) implicitly uses this `threadId` via context.

**Relevant Files for Current Stage:**

- `checkpoint-refactor.md`: This plan document.
- `apps/backend/lib/persistence/robust-checkpointer.ts`: Factory for `PostgresSaver`, calls `setup()`.
- `apps/backend/services/orchestrator.service.ts`: Core logic using checkpointer, graph, and `threadId`.
- `apps/backend/lib/utils/threads.ts`: Defines `threadId` format.
- `apps/backend/api/rfp/workflow.ts`: Handles workflow initiation/resumption API.
- `apps/backend/api/rfp/chat.ts`: Handles chat message API.
- `apps/backend/agents/proposal-generation/graph.ts`: Compiles graph with checkpointer.
- `apps/web/src/features/chat-ui/providers/StreamProvider.tsx`: Frontend SDK integration.
- `apps/backend/__tests__/thread-persistence.test.ts`: Current focus for testing.
- LangGraph Docs: Particularly `PostgresSaver` and `BaseCheckpointSaver` reference.

**Current Testing Challenge (Phase 5.4, Step 5 - Test 3):**

We are focused on verifying thread persistence in `apps/backend/__tests__/thread-persistence.test.ts`. While basic init/get tests pass using `MemorySaver`, we are facing difficulties reliably unit-testing the persistence side-effects of orchestrator methods like `addUserMessage` that involve both `graph.updateState` and `graph.invoke`.

**Specific Issues:**

- `graph.updateState` prepares the _input_ for the next `invoke` step and triggers a `checkpointer.put`.
- The actual state modification (e.g., appending messages via a reducer) typically happens _during_ `graph.invoke`.
- Mocking `graph.invoke` (necessary for unit testing) prevents the real graph execution and associated persistence triggered _by_ `invoke` from occurring.
- Asserting on the state saved _after_ `updateState` (via `checkpointer.put` args) doesn't reflect the final state _after_ invoke.
- Asserting on the state retrieved _after_ the mocked `invoke` (via `checkpointer.get`) also fails because the mock bypasses the final persistence step within the actual graph execution cycle.

This suggests that fully verifying the end-to-end persistence within a unit test requires a more sophisticated mock or should be deferred to integration testing. The current state of Test 3 in `thread-persistence.test.ts` reflects the attempt to verify the state retrieved via `getState` after a mocked `invoke`, which is currently failing.
