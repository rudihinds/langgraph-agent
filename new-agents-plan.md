# LangGraph.js Planning & Writing Agents Implementation Plan

## Overall Goal

Refactor the existing proposal generation system from a basic linear workflow into a sophisticated two-phase intelligent system: **Planning Phase** (11 specialized agents for strategic intelligence gathering) and **Writing Phase** (8 agents for adaptive content generation). This enhancement will provide users with collaborative, context-aware proposal generation that adapts to RFP complexity, industry requirements, and strategic positioning while maintaining full backward compatibility with the existing document parsing infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Foundation & State Enhancement ◻️

**Dependencies**: None (foundation work)  
**Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days

### Step 1.1: Extend State Schema ◻️

**Issue**: Current `OverallProposalState` lacks fields for planning intelligence, user collaboration tracking, and adaptive workflow management.

**Action Items**:

- Add planning intelligence fields to state schema
- Implement custom reducers for complex planning data
- Add user collaboration tracking fields
- Add adaptive workflow configuration fields

**Files to Modify**:

- `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts`
- `apps/backend/state/modules/types.ts`
- `apps/backend/state/modules/annotations.ts`

**Code Implementation**:

```typescript
// In apps/backend/state/modules/types.ts
export interface PlanningIntelligence {
  rfpCharacteristics: RFPCharacteristics;
  researchIntelligence: ResearchResults;
  industryAnalysis: IndustryInsights;
  competitiveIntel: CompetitiveAnalysis;
  requirementAnalysis: RequirementMapping;
  evaluationPrediction: EvaluationCriteria;
  strategicApproach: StrategyDecision;
  solutionRequirements: SolutionSpec;
}

export interface UserCollaboration {
  strategicPriorities: string[];
  competitiveAdvantages: string[];
  riskFactors: string[];
  userQueries: UserQuery[];
  expertiseContributions: ExpertiseContribution[];
}

export interface AdaptiveWorkflow {
  selectedApproach: WorkflowType;
  activeAgentSet: string[];
  complexityLevel: "simple" | "moderate" | "complex";
  skipReasons: Record<string, string>;
}

// Add to OverallProposalState interface
export interface OverallProposalState {
  // ... existing fields ...
  planningIntelligence: PlanningIntelligence;
  userCollaboration: UserCollaboration;
  adaptiveWorkflow: AdaptiveWorkflow;
  currentPhase: "planning" | "writing" | "complete";
}
```

**Justification**: LangGraph.js requires explicit state schema definition with proper reducers for complex nested objects. This foundation enables all subsequent planning agents to share and build upon intelligence.

### Step 1.2: Implement Custom State Reducers ◻️

**Issue**: New complex state fields need proper merging logic to avoid overwriting existing data during updates.

**Action Items**:

- Implement planning intelligence reducer
- Implement user collaboration reducer
- Add adaptive workflow reducer
- Update state annotations with new reducers

**Files to Modify**:

- `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts`

**Code Implementation**:

```typescript
// Custom reducer for planning intelligence
const planningIntelligenceReducer: BinaryOperator<PlanningIntelligence> = (
  existing = {} as PlanningIntelligence,
  incoming = {} as PlanningIntelligence
) => {
  return {
    ...existing,
    ...incoming,
    // Preserve existing data while merging new insights
    researchIntelligence: {
      ...existing.researchIntelligence,
      ...incoming.researchIntelligence,
    },
  };
};

// Add to ProposalStateAnnotation
export const ProposalStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  // ... existing annotations ...

  planningIntelligence: Annotation<PlanningIntelligence>({
    reducer: planningIntelligenceReducer,
    default: () => ({}) as PlanningIntelligence,
  }),

  userCollaboration: Annotation<UserCollaboration>({
    reducer: (existing, incoming) => ({ ...existing, ...incoming }),
    default: () => ({
      strategicPriorities: [],
      competitiveAdvantages: [],
      riskFactors: [],
      userQueries: [],
      expertiseContributions: [],
    }),
  }),

  adaptiveWorkflow: Annotation<AdaptiveWorkflow>({
    reducer: lastValueReducer,
    default: () => ({
      selectedApproach: "comprehensive",
      activeAgentSet: [],
      complexityLevel: "moderate",
      skipReasons: {},
    }),
  }),
});
```

**Justification**: LangGraph.js state management requires proper reducers to handle partial updates without data loss. Custom reducers ensure planning intelligence accumulates correctly across multiple agent interactions.

### Step 1.3: Annotation Updates (Next)

**Issue**: Need to update state annotations to reflect the new state schema and reducers.

**Action Items**:

- Update state annotations to reflect the new state schema and reducers
- Ensure compatibility with existing state management logic

**Files to Modify**:

- `apps/backend/state/proposal.state.ts`
- `apps/backend/state/modules/annotations.ts`

**Code Implementation**:

```typescript
// Update state annotations to reflect the new state schema and reducers
export const ProposalStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  // ... existing annotations ...

  planningIntelligence: Annotation<PlanningIntelligence>({
    reducer: planningIntelligenceReducer,
    default: () => ({}) as PlanningIntelligence,
  }),

  userCollaboration: Annotation<UserCollaboration>({
    reducer: (existing, incoming) => ({ ...existing, ...incoming }),
    default: () => ({
      strategicPriorities: [],
      competitiveAdvantages: [],
      riskFactors: [],
      userQueries: [],
      expertiseContributions: [],
    }),
  }),

  adaptiveWorkflow: Annotation<AdaptiveWorkflow>({
    reducer: lastValueReducer,
    default: () => ({
      selectedApproach: "comprehensive",
      activeAgentSet: [],
      complexityLevel: "moderate",
      skipReasons: {},
    }),
  }),
});
```

**Justification**: LangGraph.js state management requires proper annotations to reflect the new state schema and reducers. Updating annotations ensures compatibility with existing state management logic.

  const rfpAnalysis = await analyzeRFPComplexity(state.rfpDocument.text);

  // Determine optimal workflow approach
  const workflowDecision = selectWorkflowApproach(rfpAnalysis);

  // Create user collaboration checkpoint
  const userQuery = {
    id: `planning_${Date.now()}`,
    question:
      "Based on my analysis, I recommend a " +
      workflowDecision.approach +
      " approach for this RFP. What are your strategic priorities?",
    options: [
      "Market differentiation",
      "Cost optimization",
      "Innovation focus",
      "Risk mitigation",
    ],
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  };

  return {
    planningIntelligence: {
      ...state.planningIntelligence,
      rfpCharacteristics: rfpAnalysis,
    },
    adaptiveWorkflow: workflowDecision,
    userCollaboration: {
      ...state.userCollaboration,
